Vibration measurements are critical for diagnosing industrial machinery malfunctions because they provide information about the condition of the rotating equipment. Vibra- tion analysis is considered the most effective method for predictive maintenance because it is used to troubleshoot instantaneous faults as well as periodic maintenance. Numer- ous studies conducted in this vein have been published in a variety of outlets. This review documents data-driven and recently published deep learning techniques for vibration-based condition monitoring. Numerous studies were obtained from two reputable indexing data- bases, Web of Science and Scopus. Following a thorough review, 59 studies were selected for synthesis. The selected studies are then systematically discussed to provide researchers with an in-depth view of deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods based on vibration signals.

A. Tama et al. 1 3 1 Introduction Condition monitoring has become an essential aspect of successful industrial and manu- facturing systems. Various condition monitoring methods, such as acoustic and acoustic emission-based techniques (Govekar et al. 2000; Potočnik et al. 2007) have been preva- lent. However, among others, vibration analysis (Randall 2011; Ruiz-Cárcel et al. 2016) is deemed the most effective method for predictive maintenance since it can be used for trou- bleshooting instantaneous faults as well as periodic maintenance. As a rule of thumb, an early fault diagnosis is very crucial in modern industry since it is strongly correlated with the reduction of maintenance costs, the increase of the machine’s operating time, and the prevention of huge economic losses and devastating accidents (Lei 2016; Mohanty 2014). For machines that work under different speed conditions, the non-stationary vibration sig- nals can be preprocessed by using the speed signals so that the preprocessed signals can be readily employed for diagnosis. Therefore, it implies that the variation in the speed signals is very critical for effective fault diagnosis (Rao and Zuo 2018). Obtaining rotating speed signals of rotating machines is a challenging task. To date, there exist two main approaches to obtaining the rotating speed: (i) placing extra speed sensors to estimate speed immediately (Sarma et al. 2008), and (ii) collecting speed from vibration signals using vibration level sensors (e.g., accelerometers) (Peeters et al. 2019). Most state-of-the-art fault diagnosis techniques have been focused on the latter, as no addi- tional speed sensors are needed, and generally satisfactory results can be obtained. Dif- ferent kinds of mechanical components, such as gears and bearings, can be examined and analyzed by measuring vibration levels from sensors. In contrast, engineers often find the former challenging since placing extra speed sensors is almost impractical due to the lim- ited operating conditions. Moreover, it would not be uneconomical concerning the cost of machine condition monitoring and', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='impractical due to the lim- ited operating conditions. Moreover, it would not be uneconomical concerning the cost of machine condition monitoring and maintenance, if even possible. Analyzing vibration sig- nals involves a process of acquiring raw signals data from the device and specifying crucial properties or features that are heavily dependent on defects. Over the last few years, a vari- ety of techniques for obtaining the speed signal from vibration measurements have been studied, with the vast majority relying on the time-frequency (TF) representation tech- nique (Dziedziech et al. 2018; Iatsenko et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2017; Schmidt et al. 2018). The typical examples of TF representations are short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform. TF-based techniques have been widely used and are deemed effec- tive for speed extraction. Other methods include band-pass filtering and phase demodula- tion (Urbanek et al. 2011, 2013), Teager Kaiser energy operator (Randall and Smith 2016), and Kalman filter (Cardona-Morales et al. 2014). There have been a number of speed estimators; however, some improvements are still required to be addressed. The key challenges for speed estimators are operating changes that affect the harmonic structure and sudden speed fluctuations (Peeters et al. 2019). Moreover, there exists a need to manually select the proper model parameters to analyze the vibration signals. This circumstance will make the process labor-intensive since a huge amount of data with high dimensional features is increasing progressively. In condition monitoring, the most common way is to inspect each speed sensor measurement and set a minimum and maximum threshold value. The machine is healthy if the value is within the range, otherwise it is unhealthy. This static limit measurement might lead to a complex piece of equipment that cannot be reliably judged. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized for the health status diagnosis of rotating machinery. Fault diagnosis technologies are a mechanical extension of pattern 4669 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 recognition theory that aims to solve the problem of state classification in engineering sys- tems and operating equipment (Xu et al. 2020a; Zhang et al. 2021b). According to Xu et al. (2020a), fault detection, problem isolation, and fault identification are the three tasks that fault diagnosis systems must perform. Fault diagnosis systems can be used to assess the state of a machine while it is in use and detect any faults in real-time. Informative feature representations are typically extracted using advanced signal processing techniques, allow- ing the accurate discrimination of faults with respect to their location (Kateris et al. 2014). This feature extraction is combined with classification methods to construct mathematical representations of the relationships between all machine parameters. Classification algo- rithms take into consideration empirical data that has been measured. The algorithms learn such relationships from this data and classify new measured data to support an early diag- nosis system for rotating machinery. Classification techniques are comprised of various sta- tistical methods, neural networks (Kateris et al. 2014), and fuzzy logics (Subbaraj and Kan- napiran 2014), and, in the past few years, deep learning (DL) (Jia et al. 2016). 1.1 Research aims and contributions In the past few years, DL (LeCun et al. 2015), as a sub-field of ML, has become a leading intelligent technique applied in wide-array applications. DL-based techniques such as deep neural network (DNN) have been developed that can, automatically and without human intervention, extract deep patterns from huge raw data (Jia et al. 2016). This paper focuses on documenting an overview of DL techniques for condition monitoring using vibration data. Some recently published studies are discussed in this paper, providing research- ers and practitioners an insight into the current status of DL-based condition monitoring approaches. This review article is an extension of a previously published paper in (Tama et al. 2020) and has two main contributions: (i) To provide documentation on how DL techniques have been employed and are pres- ently addressed for vibration signal-based machine fault diagnosis; (ii) To present a benchmark on which DL models from the selected studies have per- formed better. 1.2 Research questions Following the', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",

(b) RQ2 : What types of DL techniques have been developed the most? (c) RQ3 : What are the future research directions concerning the challenges and limitations of the current studies that remain? RQ1 is addressed in Sects. 4.1 and 4.2, while Sect. 4.3 addresses RQ2 . Section 5 is devoted to answer RQ3. 4670 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 1.3 Structure The rest of the paper is broken down as follows. Section 2 conveys the basic concept of vibration signal analysis and DL, followed by Sect. 3 that presents the methodology of con- ducting the review. The results of this review are systematically classified and discussed in Sect. 4, while several directions for future research are provided in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 anticipates the threat to validity, while Sect. 7 concludes this study. 2 Fundamental concepts This section discusses the fundamental of fault diagnosis approach by using vibration sig- nal analysis and an overview of DL-based techniques (e.g., DNNs). 2.1 Vibration signal analysis for rotating machinery Besides lubricant analysis, vibration analysis and monitoring of rotating equipment are the key activities in modern industries (Randall 2011). Vibration measurement is typically per- formed online, providing a real-time source of diagnostic information on the machine’s current condition. This information is combined with other parameters to help the diag- nostic interpretation of vibration data. A common vibration-based condition monitoring system is composed of several accelerometers attached to each bearing of the machine. An extra sensor is also needed to allow the correlated analysis of signals from different sensors. Figure 1 shows some sensors installed on a laboratory-scale water pump while a nut under the looseness is typically used for developing mechanical signatures that can be related to the fault. Note that examples of faults resulting in high vibration levels in rotating machinery include misalignment of bearings, damaged bearings and gears, bent shafts, and resonance. Other components that are necessarily important in the system include on-site sig- nal conditioning modules, data acquisition, and a processing sub-system. This sys- tem enables maintenance staff or site engineers to perform real-time frequency anal- ysis of machine vibration, leading to a reasonably effective diagnostic assessment of the machine’s dynamic circumstances. Approaches that can considerably enhance the diagnostic performance of vibration monitoring are (i) an in-depth analysis of the Fig. 1 Several speed sensors are attached on a laboratory-scale water pump (a) and a nut under the looseness for developing mechanical signature (b) (Sun et al. 2020) 4671 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 huge amount of historical information of vibration signals from each sensor; and (ii) a time-correlated analysis of the signals from different sensors. Both are capable of early detection of possible damage, and improved diagnostic assurance and accuracy can be achieved. Most machine components bring about particular vibration signals, allowing them to be discriminated against by others, including distinguishing between faulty and healthy conditions. A fundamental understanding of vibration signals will diagnose faults and control machinery vibration. In order to acquire relevant information from signals, they need to be analyzed. Signals substantially carry features (e.g., information), which can be constant or vary for a specified period. Furthermore, they can be broken down into two fundamental types: (i) stationary, which means that variances in their statistical fea- tures do not exist, and (ii) non-stationary, where the time domain statistical features change with time (Mohanty 2014; Randall 2011). Stationary signals can be analyzed in either the time domain or the frequency domain. Raw signals obtained from rotating machinery are typically in the time domain, representing a collection of time-indexed data points (e.g., acceleration,', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='signals obtained from rotating machinery are typically in the time domain, representing a collection of time-indexed data points (e.g., acceleration, velocity, and background noise) obtained over a period of time. Time-domain fault diagnosis might be divided into two main categories (Ahmed and Nandi 2020): (a) Visual inspection It is performed by comparing a measured vibration signal to a formerly measured vibration signal of a machine in a normal condition. However, this type of inspection is deemed to be unreliable for the condition monitoring of rotating machines for several reasons: (i) the difference between the waveform signals is not always clearly visible, (ii) a large collection of vibration signals along with some background noises is dealt with, and (iii) early detection of faults is much desired, thus making such a manual inspection unfeasible to perform. (b) Feature-based inspection It is done by calculating particular features of the raw vibration signals. Various tech- niques include statistical functions (e.g., root mean square amplitude, peak amplitude, mean amplitude, variance, and standard deviation) and advanced techniques (e.g., time-synchronous averaging, autoregressive moving average, and filter-based method). Machinery condition monitoring commonly uses frequency (e.g., spectral) domain analysis since it provides a mechanical signature of the machine as well as the ability to discover information based on frequency characteristics. A possible change in the dynamics due to a fault or a defect in the machine can be considered as a corresponding change in the amplitude of the signals. As mentioned earlier, a rotating machine gener- ates various vibration signals in the time domain. Hence, to get the vibration signals in the frequency domain, those signals are often performed using Fourier analysis, which can be categorized into three types: Fourier series, continuous Fourier transform, and discrete Fourier transform. It is generally known that transforming a signal into the frequency domain relies upon the assumption that a frequency component does not change over time (e.g., the signal is stationary). Hence, more specifically, the Fourier transform in the frequency domain cannot serve time distribution information. Rotating machinery typically gen- erates stationary signals, but it would be possible to have non-stationary signals due to a speed swing (e.g., speed fluctuates over time) (Brandt 2011). The time-frequency 4672 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 domain has been utilized thus far for non-stationary signals, which are prevalent when machine faults happen. Several time-frequency signal analysis methods have been estab- lished, such as wavelet transform, Hilbert-Huang transform, and short-time Fourier transform. 2.2 Deep learning The birth of DNN, hereafter referred to as DL, in 2010 marked a significant breakthrough in the learning paradigm after being previously dominated by ML techniques since the 1990s. More importantly, DNN and ML form artificial intelligence (AI), which is a term that refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence without explicit pro- gramming (Simon 1969). Figure 2 shows the relationship and a time frame between AI, ML, and DL. DL uses feature learning rather than handcrafted feature engineering to perform the task (LeCun et al. 2015). It possesses unique properties over shallow ML algorithms with respect to feature learning, model construction, and model training (see Fig. 3). In addi- tion, DL comprises tens or even hundreds of layer representations that are mainly learned through models, called neural networks. A neural network is a learning algorithm in which a number of neurons and activation functions are utilized to produce a nonlinear transfor- mation of the input samples.

       " Document(page_content='The transformation provides a new representation of T휙(X) that is further used for classification F휙(.) to produce final output Y. DL techniques have been predominantly used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machin- ery. They can be trained either in a supervised or unsupervised manner or in other learn- ing paradigms, e.g., reinforcement learning (Salimans and Kingma 2016). The readers are encouraged to see a good overview of DL available in the current literature (Pouyanfar et al. 2018; Schmidhuber 2015). Several well-known DL architectures are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep belief networks (DBNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative neural networks, and graph neural network (GNN). We briefly discuss these numerous architectures in the following section. 2.2.1 Convolutional neural network (CNN) CNN, a type of neural network that specializes in processing data with a grid-like topol- ogy, was first introduced in the LeNet-5 architecture (LeCun et al. 1995) and is referred to as convolutional 2D. CNN is typically utilized on image data. Because the kernel moves along two dimensions on the data, CNN is known as a two-dimensional CNN. Conse- quently, this neural network is distinct from the one-dimensional convolutional neural net- works (1D CNN). In 1D CNN, the kernel slides along a single dimension that is typically used for time series data (Kiranyaz et al. 2021). The primary distinction between 1D and 2D CNNs is that both the kernels and the feature maps are represented by 1D arrays rather than 2D matrices (see Fig. 4 for typical CNN architecture). In addition, the computational difficulty of 1D and 2D convolutions differs significantly. For example, an image with M × M dimensions convolved with a T × T kernel will incur Fig. 4 A typical architecture of CNN (LeCun et al. 1995) 4674 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 a computational cost of O(M2T2) , whereas a comparable 1D convolution with the same dimensions (M and T) will incur a computational cost of O(MT) . This indicates that the computational complexity of a 1D CNN is considerably lower than a 2D CNN under com- parable circumstances (i.e., same design, network, and hyperparameters). Furthermore, in contrast to typical neural networks, a CNN is made up of convolutional layers followed by pooling (e.g., subsampling) layers and fully connected layers (e.g., the final stage layers) (LeCun et al. 1995) (see Fig. 4). Each layer has its own customizable parameter set and does something different to the input data. These differences are shown in Table 1. A CNN’s main building block is the convolution layer, which is responsible for the majority of the network’s computational load. This layer does a dot product between two matrices, one of which is a set of learnable parameters known as a kernel, and the other is the restricted section of the receptive field. The kernel is a fraction of the size of an input image. Suppose we have an input image of size m × n and let q × r be the size of t kernels of the convolutional layer. The kernel slides over the image’s height and width dur- ing the forward pass, providing an image representation of that receptive region. These cre- ate an activation map or feature map, a two-dimensional image representation that shows the kernel’s response at each spatial point in the image. A stride S denotes the kernel’s sliding size with the amount of padding P. Note that the size of the feature map is less than the size of the input image (see Fig. 5). Formally, the output of the convolutional layer is defined as a set of t feature maps of size ((m − q + 2P)∕S) + 1 × (n − r + 2P)∕S) + 1. Pixels in the convolutional layer are obtained by registering a weight wij to each pixel of the input image, calculating the weighted sums, and extracting related features of the image. Next, a bias 휖 is added to the weighted sums, and they are forwarded to a non-linear activation function 휑 , which can be either tanh() or sigm(). The output of the activation function ys r of a given feature map r in convolutional layer s is defined as: where 휑 is non-linear activation function and 휖s r is the bias for the s-th layer. Ms r and ⊗ denote the selected feature map i in the (s − 1)-th layer and a convolutional operator, respectively. The procedure is continue with the pooling layer. Pooling layers are similar to convo- lutional layers, but they execute a specific function, such as max pooling, which takes the largest value in a certain filter region, or', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",

Tama et al. 1 3 The limitations of the traditional CNN have led to the emergence of a new type of CNN known as Capsule Network (CapsNet). The CapsNet architecture is comprised of an encoder and a decoder (Sabour et al. 2017), each with three layers. A convolutional layer, a PrimaryCaps layer, and a DigitCaps layer make up an encoder. A decoder has three fully connected layers (see Fig. 6). The Capsule Network and CNN operate simi- larly. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use max-pooling and scalar-output feature detectors. However, in the capsule network, routing by agreement replaces max-pool- ing and CNNs’ scalar-output feature detectors are replaced with vector-output cap- sules. Therefore, capsules networks outputs are vectors that have a direction. Sabour et al. (2017) emphasize the preservation of specific information concerning an object’s location and posture across the network. This process, known as equivariance, is a cru- cial characteristic of CapsNet. Sabour et al. (2017) develop the process by employing CNN-like higher-level capsules that cover larger areas of the image. However, unlike max-pooling, CapsNet does not discard information regarding the precise location of an entity within the region. CapsNet has four main steps: Fig. 5 Convolutional process in a CNN’s convolution layer 4677 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 (i) Matrix multiplication of input vectors with weight matrices: This operation, per- formed on the input layer, converts the input image to vector values. These vectors are initially multiplied by the weight matrices. As mentioned previously, the weight matrix represents spatial relationships. (ii) Weighting the input vectors: The input weights determine the direction that the cur- rent capsules should move in the next layer. It complements the component of the dynamic routing algorithm described below. (iii) Dynamic routing algorithm: The dynamic routing technique, which follows the aims of CapsNet, facilitates communication between the PrimaryCaps and DigitCaps lay- ers. The PrimaryCaps layer (i.e., lower capsule) sends its input to the DigitCaps layer (i.e., higher-level capsules) that “agrees” with its input during this routing process. This means that lower-level attributes will only be transferred to higher-level layers whose contents match. (iv) Applying a non-linear function to condense the information: CapsNet utilizes the squashing (i.e., nonlinear) function to compress information to a length between 0 and 1 as opposed to the ReLU function used by conventional CNNs. Long vectors are compressed to a length just under one, while short vectors are compressed to nearly zero. Therefore, the length of a', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CNNs. Long vectors are compressed to a length just under one, while short vectors are compressed to nearly zero. Therefore, the length of a capsule’s output vector reflects the likelihood that a particular object is present in the current input. It is worth mentioning that CapsNet appears promising as a superior alternative to CNN, but it is still in its infancy. Therefore, researchers must continue to investigate and develop this network in order to enhance its performance and application-use potential. 2.2.2 Deep belief network (DBN) DBN is a hybrid probabilistic generative model. It can be viewed as a composi- tion of several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Hinton 2009; Hinton et al. 2006). Figure 7 shows a feedforward architecture of DBN with three hidden layers. Let {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)} be a training dataset with N instances. An input vector ⃗x comes across the nodes in the network, where DBN provides initial weights ⃗w . The objective is to minimize a cost function C: Fig. 6 A typical architecture of a Capsule Network (CapsNet) (Sabour et al. 2017) 4678 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 where hw(⃗x) is a hypothesis function, providing an predicted output. The overall cost is calculated as: where K denotes the depth of network, Lm is the number of nodes in the m-th layer, while wk ij ∈ ⃗w is the weight of edges between a node i in the layer k − 1 and a node j in the layer k. The parameter set ⃗w⋆ is calculated to minimize the overall cost function as follows. A backpropagation algorithm is commonly used to get the weight vectors ⃗w , which are updated from the top layer to the bottom layer by solving this equation: where 휉 specifies the adaptation parameter. 2.2.3 Recurrent neural network (RNN) RNN is a well-known algorithm in DL that is prevalently used in natural language process- ing and speech processing (Cho et al. 2014). It employs the sequential information in the network, thus allowing an extraction of useful knowledge from the embedded structure in a data sequence. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is an improved version of RNN. A typical LSTM network is shown in Fig. 8. The LSTM module is denoted by blue circles in the figure.

Considering Fig. 8 as an example, a conventional LSTM consists of the input vector, hidden state, and output vector at time t is ⃗xt , ⃗ht , ⃗yt , respectively. Next, the hidden state at time t is given by a function f of the input vector at time t and the hidden vector at time (t − 1) is: A separate function g is used to learn the output probabilities from the hidden states. Therefore, the output probabilities can be defined as follows. More concretely, let Wxh be the p × d input-hidden matrix, Whh be the p × p hidden-hidden matrix, and Why be the d × p hidden-output matrix, then the outputs of Eq. 9 can be rewrit- ten as: 2.2.4 Generative neural network Other DL algorithms that are prevalently used as generative neural networks are variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling 2013) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014). Generative neural networks work with two neural net- work models simultaneously. The objective of a generative neural network is to generate synthetic objects that are too realistic for the trained classifier to distinguish whether a par- ticular object belongs to the original dataset or not. VAE is an autoencoder whose training is regularized in order to avoid overfitting and ensure that the latent space has good properties that enable a generative process. VAE con- sists of both an encoder and a decoder and is trained to minimize the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the original data. First, the input is encoded as the distribution over the latent space and a point from the latent space is sampled from that distribution. Then, the sampled point is decoded and the reconstruction error is backpropa- gated. VAE uses KL-divergence as its loss function to measure the difference between the (8) ⃗ht = f(⃗ht−1, ⃗xt) (9) ⃗yt = g(⃗ht) (10) ⃗ht = tanh(Wxh⃗xt + Whh⃗ht−1 ⃗yt = Why⃗ht Fig. 8 A typical architecture of a long', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",

A. Tama et al. 1 3 generated distribution and the original distribution of the data. Suppose that a distribution z is known and generating the observation x from this distribution, which means calcu- lating the probability using Bayes’ theorem as Eq. 11, is necessary. However, due to the probability p(x), which is calculated as Eq. 12 with the integral form, calculating p(z|x) is difficult. Instead of directly calculating p(z|x), p(z|x) can be estimated as q(z|x) through minimizing the KL-divergence loss as Eq. 13. Equation 13 can be converted to the maximization prob- lem as Eq. 14, where Eq(z|x) log p(x|z) is the reconstruction likelihood and KL(q(z|x)||p(z)) indicates how the estimated distribution q is similar to the prior distribution p. Finally, the total loss for VAE can be expressed as Eq. 15 and is backpropagated to the net- work (Kingma and Welling 2013). GAN is another kind of generative neural networks, which learns deep representations without extensively annotated training data and can be used for both supervised and unsu- pervised learning. GAN can be described as a two-player game between the ”generator” and the ”discriminator”. On the one hand, the generator artificially generates samples that are intended to come from the same distribution of the real data and is trained to deceive the discriminator. On the other hand, the discriminator classifies samples into two classes (i.e., real and fake) and is trained using the traditional classifiers not to be deceived by the generator (Figs. 9 and 10). GAN is typically implemented by multi-layer neural networks with convolutional and/ or fully connected layers. A prior on input noise variables is represented as pz(z) to learn the generator’s distribution pg over the generated data x. Mapping to a data space is illus- trated as G(z;휃g) and D(x;휃d) , where G is a differentiable function, which is represented by a multi-layer perceptron with 휃g , and D(x) indicates the probability that x came from the real data rather than the generator’s distribution (i.e., pg ). D is trained to maximize the probability of assigning the correct labels to both the samples from the real data and the samples from G, while G is simultaneously trained to minimize log(1 − D(G(z))) . The process above can be illustrated as follows, which is a minimax game with value function V(G, D) (Goodfellow 2016; Goodfellow et al. 2014).

(2009) first proposed GNNs, which aim to use graph theory to develop a neural network that could model graph data. In response to the success of CNNs, RNNs, and autoen- coders in DL, new methodologies and descriptions have been extended to complex graph data, resulting in graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs), and graph auto-encoders (GAEs). These GNNs have been applied successfully in a wide number of domains. However, there is a dearth of applications for using GNNs to diag- nose faults in rotating machinery via vibration data. Figure 11 illustrates a typical GNN archi- tecture for fault diagnosis. A simple graph can be represented as: where V and E are the sets of nodes and edges, respectively. Let vi ∈ V be a node and eij = (vi, vj) ∈ E denote an edge between vi and vj . Then, the neighborhood of a node v can be defined as M(v) = {u ∈ V|(v, u) ∈ E} . Usually, a graph can be described by an adja- cency matrix A ∈ RM×M where M is the number of nodes, that is, M = |V| . In particu- lar, Aij = 1 if {vi, vj} ∈ E and i ≠ j;Aij = 1 , otherwise. In a directed graph, Aij represents an (17) G = G(V, E) Fig. 9 A basic architecture of a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling 2013) Fig. 10 A typical architecture of GAN (Goodfellow et al. 2014) 4682 B.

A degree matrix DM ∈ RM×M is a diagonal matrix, which can be obtained as DMii = ∑N j=1 Aij . The graph can be represented as the Laplacian matrix LM. The relationship between the degree matrix, the adjacency matrix, and the Laplacian matrix is illustrated in Fig. 12. The Laplacian matrix is defined as: GNN receives two piece of information as the input, the feature matrix 퐗 and the adjacency matrix 퐀 .

Like images, industrial networks often represent a structure. For example, a station voltage in an electric power system may be independent of a remote load but be highly correlated to a nearby generator. Unfortunately, CNNs perform well only for regular data structures like images and cannot achieve the same performance for domains with an irregular structure like industrial networks. The data’s geometrical structure in the graph structure can provide additional information, as they encompass the nodes’ val- ues and their relationships. As a result, the graph structure can convey more informa- tion than regular data structures. Recently, GCNs have been introduced to generalize CNN to some irregular or, more generally, non-Euclidean domains (Bruna et al. 2013). Input, convolution, coarsening, and pooling are the four fundamental phases of a graph convolutional network. More precisely, four fundamental phases can be described as follows. (i) Graphs may express the geometry and structure of data as input to a neural network and therefore provide more information than other general data formats. (ii) Fast-localized filters based on graph spectral theory and Chebyshev expansion are utilized to conduct a convolution operator on a graph. (iii) A graph coarsening process is conducted to group similar vertices together. (iv) For graph pooling, the vertices are rearranged by first generating a balanced binary tree then applying regular 1D pooling. The GCN’s output can be derived based on Eq. 19 and following the suggestion by Kipf and Welling (2017), therefore it is defined as: where ̃퐀 = 퐀 + 퐈M, 퐈M is the identity matrix of order M, and ̃ 퐃퐌 is a diagonal matrix, whose diagonal elements are ̃ 퐃퐌ii = ∑M j=1 ̃퐀ij.𝜎 is an activation function, e.g., the ReLu function. 훩 ∈ Rc×c is the parameter matrix of the network to be learned, c′ represents the dimension of the output, and 퐙 ∈ RM×c is the output matrix. The cross-entropy loss function that is generally used to train the parameters is defined as: here Mtr represents the number of training points, P is the number of categories, 퐙 is obtained from Eq. 20, and 퐘 is the corresponding label of the training set. It should be noted that in a classification problem, the dimension of the output equals the number of categories, i.e., c = P (Kipf and Welling 2017). Figure 13 shows a graph convolutional network-based fault diagnosis method using vibration signals. The framework is comprised of several steps, including a graph construction of the vibration signals, followed by apply- ing a certain activation function like the softmax function as the classifier for mechanical fault diagnosis.

More precisely, we searched two well-known indexing databases, such as Scopus and Web of Sci- ence, to incorporate all prior works comprehensively. The two indexing databases normally provide indexing services for journals published by IEEE, ACM, Springer, Elsevier, John Wiley & Sons, and other publishers. We limited our search to these databases because: (i) the databases are supposed to archive high-quality papers; and (ii) to avoid multiple searches, which are typically available at each publication outlet. Some search keywords were derived from index terms found in some papers. The search keywords were combined using Boolean operators, i.e., AND and OR, resulting in the following combination of the keywords.

All studies considered in this review must be papers that were published in journals because journal articles represent the highest level of research outcomes and have been thoroughly peer-reviewed (Nord and Nord 1995). Furthermore, the papers must be written in English and discuss DL and vibra- tion signals for rotating machinery. The steps involved in the study inclusion and exclusion, including the number of relevant studies at each step, are presented in Fig. 14. 4 Result and discussion This section is devoted to answer RQ1 and RQ2 . It is comprised of the discussion about the research trend, publication venues, and the categorization of the selected studies w.r.t DL techniques. 4.1 Research trend According to the trend (see Fig. 15), the number of studies has been varying over time. There have been a surge studies between 2017 and 2021, while in contrast, there exist lim- ited studies in 2016. Moreover, there has been at least five studies have been identified dis- cussing the application of DL techniques in fault diagnosis using vibration signals. 4.2 Publication venue This section presents the dissemination of the selected studies by considering the publica- tion outlets. Table 3 enumerates all publication outlets, where the selected studies were published based on the journal title, number of studies, publisher, and the relative percent- age to the total number of selected studies. The selected studies appeared in 27 kinds of journals, where the Measurement journal (10 articles) takes the predominant publications in this field. It is followed by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement that shares 7 articles. Next, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics and Mechani- cal Systems and Signal Processing share 5 articles each, while other well-known journals are IEEE Access (3 articles) and IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (3 articles). The other outlets that share the same number of publications (2 articles) are Advances in Mechanical Engineering, Computers in Industry, International Journal of Advanced Manu- facturing Technology, ISA Transactions, and Neurocomputing. Lastly, the rest outlets had published one article of the total selected studies. 4.3 Categorization of selected studies w.r.t. deep learning methods As previously noted, condition monitoring is an integral component of condition-based maintenance. Maintenance is determined in accordance with the machine’s health, which can be identified through the condition monitoring system.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the quantity of work applying DL to condition monitor- ing. This section discusses state-of-the-art approaches for fault diagnosis based on DL and vibration analysis. Figure 16 illustrates the contribution of each DL technique to the overall number of studies chosen. The vast majority of research uses CNNs, followed by stacked autoencoders (SAEs), accounting for 39.0% and 28.8% of the total studies, respectively. GNNs account for 20.3% of the total research, while RNNs and DBNs account for 6.8% and 5.1%, respectively. 4.3.1 Convolutional neural network (CNN) The results of selected studies utilizing CNNs for vibration-based fault diagnosis are sum- marized (in chronological order) in Table 4. A novel hierarchical adaptive CNN is studied in (Guo et al. 2016). By adopting a CNN architecture provided in (Slavkovikj et al. 2015), Janssens et al. (2016) propose a feature learning model for conditional monitoring. A novel contribution to the spindle bearing fault diagnosis is proposed (Ding and He 2017). The proposed approach is based on energy-fluctuated multiscale feature mining using the wavelet packet energy image and CNN. An effective and reliable bearing fault diagnosis approach based on CNN is investigated in (Lu et al. 2017a). The CNN model can reduce learning computation requirements in the temporal dimension. It is worth mentioning that a dislocated layer can be added to the original CNN. The authors in (Liu et al. 2017) pro- pose a method called dislocated time series CNN to develop a new diagnosis framework based on the characteristics of industrial vibration signals. The authors of (Jing et al. 2017) develop CNN to learn features directly from the frequency data of vibration signals. The effectiveness of the proposed CNN is evaluated on the PHM 2009 gearbox challenge data and planetary gearbox test rig. A new approach for fault types and severity of the gearbox health monitoring system is presented (Wang et al. 2017). A deep CNN learns the underly- ing features in the time-frequency domain and performs classification.

Experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model with a classification accuracy of more than 99.5%. A combination of CNN and support vector machine (SVM) for machinery fault diag- nosis techniques is proposed (You et al. 2017). CNN promotes feature extraction capa- bility, while SVM is used for multi-class classification. The proposed model is evaluated using the real acoustic signals from locomotive bearings and vibration signals measured from the automobile transmission gearbox. A new CNN based on LeNet-5 for fault diag- nosis method is detailed in (Wen et al. 2018). By converting signals into two-dimensional images, the proposed method can extract the features and wipe out the ones with manual design features. A novel method suitable for mechanical data analysis, called LiftingNet, is proposed (Pan et al. 2018). Two different motor-bearing datasets validate the effectiveness of LiftingNet. A learning paradigm called transfer learning based on CNN is employed in (Cao et al. 2018). In this research, transfer learning is applied to gearbox fault diagnosis, while vibration responses are obtained using accelerometers during gearbox operation. A study undertaken in (Chen et al. 2019a) employs a data fusion technique to determine the health condition of a machine. The classification is then performed using a deep convolu- tional neural network (DCNN). The findings indicate that DCNNs outperform SVMs and backpropagation neural networks. A multi-sensor data fusion and bottleneck layer optimization of CNN are discussed in (Wang et al. 2019a). The proposed approach has been validated on a wind-powered test 4690 B. A.

A rolling-element bearing fault diagnosis technique based on CNN’s deep structure is carried out in (Hoang and Kang 2019). When using vibration signals directly as input data, the proposed technique has high accuracy and robustness in noisy environments. Another CNN variant named deep capsule network with a stochastic delta rule (DCN-SDR) for rolling bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in (Chen et al. 2019b). DCN-SDR uses a raw temporal signal as its input and achieves very high accuracy under a noisy environment. The authors in (Khodja et al. 2020) use CNN and vibration spectrum imaging for classifying bearing faults. The proposed classifier is evalu- ated in terms of classification accuracy, variable load and speed testing, generalization, and robustness by adding noise to the collected data. Wu et al. (2021) consider a semi-super- vised CNN for the intelligent diagnosis of bearings. A 1-D CNN is applied to learn spatial features and generates class probabilities of unlabeled samples. A pre-fully connected deep CNN approach is presented in (Zhu et al. 2020) to obtain comprehensive bearing vibration characteristics. The front fully connected layer, designed to reduce the signal’s complexity, extracts the signal’s global characteristics. Yu et al. (2020) introduce one-dimensional CNN as a feature extractor, while the fully connected layer is adopted as the main element of two-symmetric classifiers. Moreover, the cosine similarity is used to guide the adversarial training process of the two classifiers. Yang et al. (2020) propose a diagnosis model combined with polynomial kernel induced maximum mean discrepancy (PK-MMD) to reuse diagnosis knowledge from one machine to the other. The proposed method uses the ResNet model to extract features from the sam- ples in the source and target domains. Wu et al. (2020b) introduce two transfer situations for rotating machinery intelligent diagnosis and construct seven few-shot transfer learning methods based on a unified 1-D CNN. A novel deep transfer learning based on modified ResNet-50 is proposed by (Wang et al. 2020). The ResNet-50 model extracts low-level fea- tures, constructs a multiple scale feature learner, and obtains high-level features as the clas- sifier’s input. Finally, to tackle a small dataset, Liang et al. (2021) utilize parallel CNN for bearing fault identification. Two different CNNs are constructed parallel to extract features in the time and frequency domains. The two features are then fused in the merged layer as the inputs of the final classifier. 4.3.2 Deep belief network (DBN) Yu et al.

Tama et al. 1 3 4.3.3 Recurrent neural network (RNN) A study presented by (Liu et al. 2018) discusses a fault-bearing diagnosis method based on RNN in the form of an autoencoder. In this technique, the rolling bearings’ vibration data for the next period are predicted based on the previous period using a gated recur- rent unit (GRU)-based denoising autoencoder. Assessing the performance degradation of bearings using LSTM is proposed in (Zhang et al. 2019). The proposed model can effec- tively identify degradation states and accurately predict the bearings’ remaining useful life. A DL model called many-to-many-to-one bidirectional long short-term memory (MMO- BLSTM) is proposed to automatically extract the rotating speed from vibration signals. The proposed model’s performance is validated on an internal combustion engine data- set, a rotor system dataset, and a fixed-shaft gearbox dataset (Rao et al. 2020). Xu et al. (2020b) propose a deep residual network (DRN) and LSTM to process extracted features obtained from multisensory system condition data. The proposed method shows robust and superior performance for the two datasets, including cutting tool monitoring and bearing fault diagnosis. 4.3.4 Stacked autoencoders Jia et al. (2016) use two main procedures to train DNN such as pre-train DNNs with autoencoder and fine-tune DNNs with a backpropagation algoritm for classification. Simi- larly, Sun et al. (2016) utilize a sparse autoencoder to improve the robustness of feature representation. Features learned from SAE are further used to train a neural network clas- sifier. An intelligent severity identification of rolling bearing faults can be obtained using a stack of multiple sparse autoencoders with a classifier layer (Chen et al. 2017). A fea- ture learning ability can be improved by combining denoising and contractive autoencod- ers (Shao et al. 2017a). To further increase the quality of the learnt features, a locality preserving projection is used to fuse the deep features. Likewise, a stacked sparse autoen- coder (SAE) is employed for machine fault diagnosis (Qi et al. 2017). Preprocessing is performed on the collected non-stationary and transient signals using ensemble empirical model decomposition and autoregressive models. The study (Mao et al. 2017) proposes an autoencoder-ELM-based approach for identifying bearing defects. Research published in (Lu et al. 2017b) analyzes an effective and reliable approach for identifying the health condition of a machine using a stacked denoising autoencoder. The suggested model is shown to be a promising method for identifying specific health states from data incorporat- ing ambient noise and variations in working conditions (Tables 5 and 6). Furthermore, a novel deep autoencoder feature learning is proposed for diagnosing rotating machinery fault (Shao et al. 2017b). The proposed method is built based on maxi- mum correntropy to design the new loss function for the improvement of feature learning from the measured vibration signals. A local connection network (LCN) developed using a normalized sparse autoencoder (NSAE), called LCN-NSAE, is suggested for intelligent fault diagnosis (Jia et al. 2018). The proposed technique incorporates feature extraction and fault detection into a general-purpose learning procedure to improve the fault diagno- sis system. An effective DNN with an unsupervised feature learning algorithm based on a sparse autoencoder is presented in (Ahmed et al. 2018). The study explores the effects of a sparse autoencoder on the classification performance of highly compressed measurements of bearing vibration signals. 4695 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 Table 5 Summary of stacked autoencoder-based fault diagnosis methods using vibration signals CWRU Case Western Reserve University Ref.

A. Tama et al. 1 3 An automatic and accurate identification of rolling bearing faults using an ensemble of deep autoencoders (EDAEs) is studied in (Shao et al. 2018). The proposed method is applied to analyze experimental bearing vibration signals. A new bearing fault diagnosis method based on a fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoder has been developed (Li et al. 2018). A soft voting method is applied to combine the prediction results of signal segments sliced by the slicing window to improve accuracy and stability. A DNN based on stacked sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for bearing fault diagnosis is built (Sun et al. 2018). The proposed method is compared with traditional methods such as a single-hidden-layer backward propagation neural network (BPNN) and SVM.

       " Document(page_content='(BPNN) and SVM. A work in (He and He 2019) utilizes a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) autoencoder to calculate the spectral average of the vibration signals. The reconstructed vibration signals are then fed into the softmax classifier for bearing fault diagnosis. Li et al. (2020b) introduce a unique augmented deep sparse autoencoder that diagnoses gear pitting faults with few raw vibration data. By validating six types of gear pitting conditions, the proposed method is very accurate and robust. Wu et al. (2020a) propose a fault-attention probabilistic adversarial autoencoder that obtains a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the vibration signal’s high-dimensional space. Lastly, Shao et al. (2020) combine particle swarm optimization and a stacked autoencoder for intelligent fault diagnosis techniques on various rotating machines. 4.3.5 Graph neural network (GNN) Researchers have been paying close attention to GNNs, an emerging specialized graph sig- nal processing algorithm (Zhou et al. 2020). By aggregating information from the node’s neighbors at any depth, GNN can more effectively extract and inference data relationships. Using a horizontal visibility graph (HVG) and a GNN, Li et al. (2020a) suggested a new model for bearing faults diagnosis. The HVG algorithm turns a time series sample into a graph with condition-specific topology. Compared to pure numerical information, the proposed method gives additional valuable information for classification. Li et al. (2020a) prove that the GNN model outperforms the RNN model for bearing faults diagnosis. The graph convolutional network (GCN) is a variety of neural networks that establishes associations between data using an association graph to speed up training and improve model performance (Bruna et al. 2013). Zhou et al. (2022), propose a GCN-based rotating machinery fault diagnosis method that uses multi-sensor data. To diagnose problems in wind turbine gearboxes, Yu et al. (2021) suggested a fast deep graph convolutional network (FDGCN). The proposed FDGCN efficiently and adaptively learns the discriminative fault features from the initial graph input and then uses these learnt features to categorize the associated fault type. Zhang et al. (2020) applied a deep GCN (DGCN) to diagnose acous- tic-based faults for roller bearings. Overall, the DGCN method has outperformed existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy, and it can be used to detect various types and degrees of faults in roller bearings. To handle the unbalanced dataset problem for fault diagnosis, Liu et al. (2021) use an autoencoder-based SuperGraph feature learning method. However, the constructed Super- Graph by Yang et al. (2022) has redundant edges; all labeled signals with the same fault type are interconnected, resulting in excessive computational costs. Li et al. (2021b), on the other hand, used a multireceptive field graph convolutional network (MRF-GCN) to solve the constraints of GCNs for effective intelligent fault diagnosis. Case studies demonstrate that MRF-GCN outperforms other algorithms even when the dataset is unbalanced. 4699 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 Furthermore, Chen et al. (2021) pre-diagnose faults by using the structural analysis (SA) method and construct it into an association graph. Then, to adjust the influence of meas- urements and prior knowledge, a weight coefficient is introduced. The suggested method produces superior diagnosis findings than existing methods based on common evaluation indicators. Zhang et al. (2021b) propose using gated recurrent units (GRUs) in their novel FDGRU method for fault diagnosis. FDGRU stabilizes the training process and improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Additionally, in the unsupervised fault diagnosis domain, (Li et al. 2021a) propose using a domain adversarial graph convolutional network (DAGCN) to solve the data dis- crepancy between source and target domain in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for machinery fault diagnosis. According to experimental data, the suggested DAGCN extracts the transferable domain-invariant and discriminative features for domain adaptation and achieves excellent performance among the six comparison approaches. Zhao et al. (2021a) propose a multiple-order graphical deep ELM (MGDELM) algorithm to synchronously extract local and global structural information from raw data.

(2021b) propose a new semisupervised deep convolutional belief network (SSD-CDBN) for motor-bearing fault diagnosis. This method used both labeled and unla- beled data information. 4.4 Datasets This section explains various publicly available datasets employed to diagnose faults using vibration signals. More specifically, we include datasets well-known in the literature: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the University of Paderborn (UPB) bearing dataset, the Southeast University (SEU) gearbox dataset, and several other datasets. The following sections provide additional information about the datasets. (a) Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Dataset (Loparo 2012) Widely used in fault diagnosis studies, this benchmark dataset can be obtained via CWRU’s public-bearing data center. The test rig is comprised of a two-horsepower induction motor, a torque transducer or encoder, and a dynamometer. The accelerom- eter near the motor-driven end acquires the vibration signal at a sampling frequency of 12 kHz. Electric discharge machining (EDM) introduces single-point flaws into test bearings, resulting in three severity levels of damage with diameters of 0.007, 0.014, and 0.021 in, respectively. Bearing faults are classified into three types based on their location: inner-race fault, outer-race fault, and ball fault. In addition, a normal condition bearing is evaluated. As a result, these datasets represent ten bearing defect patterns under four different motor loads of 0, 1, 2, and 3 horsepower. (b) Paderborn University Dataset (Lessmeier et al. 2016) Paderborn University (PU) provides this experimental bearing dataset for condition monitoring and diagnostics based on motor current and vibration signals. Because of the vast amount of data and variety of bearing testing types, the dataset includes a large mining space test rig for bearing condition monitoring as well as an accelerated lifetime test rig. The bearing condition monitoring test rig is a modular system that includes a load motor, a flywheel, a bearing test module, a torque measurement shaft, and a driving motor. To collect the essential data, it is necessary to reproduce relevant bearing faults. The vibration signal is one measured variable from the housing vibra- tions in the form of acceleration at the bearing housing in the bearing test stand. 4700 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 (c) University of Connecticut Dataset (Cao et al. 2018) A two-stage gearbox with changeable gears was used to capture vibration signals. The gear speed is controlled by a motor. The torque is provided by a magnetic brake, the input voltage of which can be modified. A 32-tooth pinion and an 80-tooth gear are coupled to the first stage input shaft. The second stage is made up of a 48-tooth pinion and a 64-tooth gear. The input shaft speed is determined by a tachometer, and an accelerometer determines the gear vibration signals. A dSPACE system is used to sample the signals at a rate of 20 kHz. There are nine different gear conditions listed on the input shaft, including healthy condition, missing tooth, root fracture, spalling, and chipped tip. Using a non-preprocessing technique, the vibration signals were converted into images in order to reveal the 2D features of the raw data. The final image repre- sentation of the signal is a grayscale image 227×227 in size. Using the experimental gearbox, 104 signals were collected for each gear state, with 3600 angle-even samples taken for each signal. (d) XJTU-SY Bearing Dataset (Wang et al. 2018) An alternating current (AC) induction motor, a motor speed controller, a support shaft, two support bearings (heavy-duty roller bearings), and a hydraulic loading system are all part of the bearing testbed. This testbed was designed to speed up the deterioration of rolling element bearings under a variety of operating situations. There are three different operating circumstances, and each working state was tested with five bear- ings. Two accelerometers, one on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis, are mounted at 90◦ on the housing of the tested bearings to gather vibration signals. The sampling frequency is set at 25.6 kHz. Each sample collects 32,768 data points (i.e., 1.28 s), and the sampling time is 1 min.

Even though present-day developments in DL have been eye- opening, several challenges and limitations remain, some of which are mentioned as fol- lows. Noise signals containing working environment fluctuations might be obtained from real-world industrial applications. Hence, it is still challenging to determine whether the 4701 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 current DL algorithms can perform well under such noisy data. Like DL techniques applied in other application domains, an imbalanced dataset might be crucial. The vast majority of the machine health data obtained would be under normal or healthy circumstances, which directly affects the training process of fault diagnosis models. Additionally, the interpretability of DL algorithms for fault diagnosis utilizing vibra- tion signals is still underexplored. The internal mechanism of DL algorithms has not been divulged due to a lack of interpretability and explainability. To address this issue, some solutions have been developed, such as feature visualization (Matthew and Fergus 2014) and coarse localization maps (e.g., class activation maps (CAMs)) (Selvaraju et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2016). The former focuses on visualizing feature maps in which the first layers define local patterns such as edges, circles, and so on, while the subsequent layers blend them into more meaningful structures. Similarly, the latter generates CAMs that identify the important portions of a picture used in prediction. By using CAMs, it will be feasible to gain a better grasp of the image’s problematic regions. It is also worth noting that the inter- pretability of CAMs will aid us in selecting the critical component for detecting the most vibrating regime without the need for vibration sensors. An example of CAMs utilized for defect detection in a laboratory-scale water pump is shown in Fig. 17. Other research utilizes SincNet to address interpretability (Abid et al. 2020) from a fre- quency domain perspective. SincNet uses parameterized Sinc functions to assist the first layer in identifying more meaningful filters (Ravanelli and Bengio 2018). Temporal repre- sentations of the Sinc filter kernels are expressed in both frequency and time domains with distinct low and high cut-off frequencies. This approach makes the network focus on high- level parameters, which must have a clear physical meaning. Based on layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) (Bach et al. 2015), Grezmak et al. (2019) introduce an interpretable CNN for gearbox fault diagnosis. Utilizing LRP, the network can explain the reasoning behind the results by indicating which time-frequency points in the spectra images con- tribute most to the fault (Grezmak et al. 2019). Li et al. (2022) propose WaveletKernel- Net (WKN) and introduce an interpretable convolution kernel that extracts significant fault information components in vibration signals. A continuous wavelet convolution (CWConv) layer is used to replace the standard CNN’s initial convolution layer in order to uncover kernels with a specific physical meaning (Li et al. 2022).

Furthermore, while the DL algorithm for fault diagnosis is a solely data-driven algorithm that may well suit observations, predictions may be inconsistent or unrea- sonable due to extrapolation or observational biases, resulting in poor generalization Fig. 17 An example of CAM used for identifying the most vibrating regime of a laboratory- scaled water pump (Sun et al. 2020). The red area indicates the most vibrating regime 4702 B. A. Tama et al. 1 3 performance. As a result, there is an urgent need to incorporate fundamental physical principles and domain knowledge into the DL algorithm in order to govern physical norms, which could provide informative priors or substantial theoretical limitations and inductive biases on top of observational biases. Therefore, physics-informed learn- ing, an act of leveraging prior knowledge derived from the observational, empirical, physical, or mathematical understanding of the environment to improve a learning algo- rithm’s performance, is required (Karniadakis et al. 2021). This recent development is known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al. 2019). DL based on physics is still in its early research stages and requires careful configuration for each challenge. One key goal is to develop PINNs for uncertainty quantification to create a robust and reliable forecast. The basic idea is to employ neural networks as universal approximators of the intended solution, then constrain the training process by defining the loss function based on domain knowledge (Raissi et al. 2019). By using automatic differentiation to integrate partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function of a neural network, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) incorporate information from both measurements and PDEs. Finally, another consideration for further direction is the use of the self-attention mechanism. Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017), the most recent development for this solution, has outperformed previous techniques, such as CNNs and RNNs, in various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), point cloud, and picture analy- sis (Pei et al. 2021). Although the transformer is a revolutionary design for DL model architectures, it has been underexplored in the realm of fault diagnosis until Pei et al. (2021) introduced the transformer convolution network (TCN) for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The TCN uses a multi-layered attention stacking strategy for remarkable parallel and learning abilities. In addition, the TCN demonstrates remarkable stability and resilience against noise due to the stability of the automatic feature extraction by the transformer with the attention mechanism. However, some modest modifications are required to make the TCN completely appropriate for fault diagnosis utilizing vibra- tion signals. Moreover, there are several limitations that must be addressed in order to improve TCN performance. Including scenarios with extremely limited fault samples, its effectiveness in real-world industrial applications has not been thoroughly verified. The transformer encoder’s computational complexity is another unresolved research gap that requires further investigation (Pei et al. 2021). Most of these studies concentrate on automatic fault diagnosis of the bearing fault, the most prevalent issue in industrial and manufacturing systems. However, machine failures reveal a reaction chain between cause and defect. The rotating machinery works involve rotational motion such as gears, rotors and shafts, rolling element bearings, flex- ible couplings, and electrical machines (Gu et al. 2018; Guan 2017; Guo et al. 2021; Gupta and Pradhan 2017; Peng et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2019b; Zhang et al. 2021a; Zhu et al. 2021). Due to the complex structure and interaction of multiple components in rotating machinery, there are additional faults that will need to be diagnosed in the future in order to improve results: (i) Coupling faults. (ii) Pitting of race and ball/roller (i.e., rolling element faults). (iii) Ball screw faults. (iv) Rotors and shaft faults (e.g., misalignment, unbalance, and loose components). (v) Electrical machine faults. 4703 Recent advances in the application of deep learning for fault… 1 3 6 Threat to validity Some of the factors considered as potential threats to this study are summarily discussed here.', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c5d060c21ca59a20b760260134826d8c6565dde.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of deep learning for fault… 1 3 6 Threat to validity Some of the factors considered as potential threats to this study are summarily discussed here. Some search keywords were drawn from keywords found in some papers to reduce the risk of excluding relevant studies. The search was restricted to two primary index- ing databases to minimize bias and miss relevant papers. Other researchers’ biases can be unavoidable, such as inaccurate data extraction and mapping procedure. A consensus mechanism was utilized to select all the extracted studies to minimize this issue. The final chosen studies and classification were made by consensus among the four authors. 7 Conclusion DL techniques have solved complex problems across various applications and research concerning the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper has documented an overview of DL algorithms for condition monitoring using vibration signals. Through this study, existing studies were reviewed and classified according to the DL architec- tures. Moreover, some current research challenges were reported, providing researchers insights into the latest DL techniques for fault diagnosis. More importantly, a ’white- box’ model for fault diagnosis will be sought after as it helps the prediction be under- standable to humans. To conclude, this section sums up the answers to the RQs men- tioned earlier. (a) RQ1 : What are the distribution per year and publication venues of prior works related to the applications of DL for vibration-based fault diagnosis techniques? This study has observed DL for fault diagnosis using vibration signals either in supervised, unsu- pervised, or semi-supervised learning mechanisms. This study reveals that there has been a considerable increase between 2017 and 2021. (b) RQ2 : What types of DL techniques are developed the most? Supervised learning task based on CNN was still the major player in this domain, which shared more than one- third of the total studies. Other significant DL techniques that have been developed include stack autoencoder and graph-based neural networks. (c) RQ3 : What are the future research directions concerning the challenges and limitations of the current studies that remain? DL models are black-box; therefore, the model’s interpretability and explainability would be very promising tools in the future. In addi- tion, physics-informed ML and the self-attention mechanism remain underexplored in the current literature.

Due to the per-tinence and market presence of the underlying polymers, the ﬁndings of this paper also apply to a wider spectrum of bio-based products and therefore inform the environmental policy on the expected repercussions for large scale bio-sourcing. Abstract: The textile industry has lately started exploring the possibility of bio-sourcing for synthetics, notably polyester ﬁber, in the effort to break from the proven fossil-fuel dependency and decrease the environmental impacts. Traditionally made out of fossil-based polyethylene terephthalate polymer, polyester can be functionally substituted with three bio-based alternatives: bio-polyester, poly- trimethylene terephthalate, and polylactic acid ﬁbers. At present, however, there is a lack of studies on the environmental effects of such substitution. We, therefore, performed a comparative, cradle-to- gate life cycle assessment of conventional polyester and those substitutes featuring varying levels of bio-content. The impact assessment was performed with the most recent version of the Envi- ronmental Footprint method including some adaptations—using carbon crediting and a different, distance-to-target weighting approach. Bio-sourced ﬁbers are found to cause higher environmental burdens than polyester. Acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, water, and land use increase with the bio-content and are predominantly linked to the ﬁrst generation feedstock (agriculture and trans- port). The results on climate change vary with the impact method adaptations, yet do not manage to offset the aforementioned deteriorations. In single scores, only three out of nine substitutes are found to perform comparably, while the rest perform signiﬁcantly worse than the incumbent ﬁber. Keywords: polyester; bio-polyester; polytrimethylene terephthalate; polylactic acid; bio-based; bio-sourcing; life cycle assessment; circular economy 1. Introduction Numerous studies from public agencies, the scientiﬁc community and businesses have shown that the current practices throughout the textile supply chain go against the sector’s long-term sustainability. Business-as-usual in this resource-intensive sector involves a very high fossil-fuel dependency, produces excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, uses high quantities of water, and causes substantial water pollution and other burdens to the environment [1–3]. A major component in the textile industry is ﬁbers. As intermediate products, they are a common denominator for all subsequent products such as yarn or garments. On the ﬁber market, polyester ﬁber accounts for little over half of the entire annual global ﬁber production [4]. In the textile industry, polyester conventionally refers to a ﬁber produced by melt spinning the amorphous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer, even though polymer science groups many compounds, including PET, into polyesters. Hence, it is a fossil-based product, where the entirety of the embedded carbon (C) comes from the Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993. https://doi.org/10.3390/app11072993 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 2 of 19 fossil-based feedstock.

       " Document(page_content='https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 2 of 19 fossil-based feedstock. In order to mitigate the environmental impacts of its products, to decouple from the dependency on fossil resources, and to meet the sustainability-minded consumer trends, the textile industry needs to rethink its current supply chains. At the same time, “the ever-increasing consumption of textiles and clothing is only expected to intensify the social and environmental issues” associated with their production [5]. Bio-sourcing is a solution, which supposedly has an effect on all the aforementioned environmental impacts. It is particularly relevant for polyester ﬁber due to ﬁber’s market dominance. Bio-sourcing relies on feedstock diversiﬁcation, whereby so-called renewable or bio-based feedstock such as crops (edible, ﬁrst-generation) or lignocellulosic mass (non-edible, second-generation) displaces the conventional fossil-based inputs [6,7]. In short, bio-sourcing rests on the idea that changing the provenance of C in the product’s backbone results in a decrease in the environmental impacts of the said product. The share of total carbon in the product coming from the bio-based feedstock is expressed as % of bio-based C content, ranging from 0% bio-C (in case of fossil-based polyester) to 100% bio-C (when the polyester is entirely produced out of bio-based feedstock), with “partially bio-based” capturing everything in between. Due to the current lack of standardization in the bio-based ﬁeld, both entirely and partially bio-based products are simply called “bio-based”. Moreover, the European Commission (EC) particularly supports this strategy with its recent European Green Deal [8]. Through these activities, the EC aims to stimulate the development of new markets for climate-neutral and circular products, especially in resource-intensive sectors, such as textiles and plastics (with relevant overlaps in polymer production) [8]. In this light, polyester ﬁbers could largely be substituted by three bio-based alterna- tives, minding the necessary functionalities of the ﬁber in different applications [9]. By accounting for the technical substitution potential of the total polyester put on the market, Shen et al. [9] report that 65% of polyester can be substituted by bio-polyester, 20% by polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) ﬁbers, and 10% by polylactic acid (PLA) ﬁbers. In the ﬁrst case, the substitute ﬁber is chemically identical to polyester, but the production chain has been revised and slightly modiﬁed to accommodate bio-sourcing for the two underlying PET monomers. Such an approach is referred to as drop-in substitution [10]. Secondly, PTT ﬁber, also known as Triexta (with the Federal Trade Commissions in the United States), is a ﬁber made out of the homonymous polymer with favorable material properties in substituting the conventional polyester ﬁber [11]. The industry has known PTT ﬁber for a long time (i.e., it was discovered in 1941 as a fossil-based ﬁber), but the production cost of one of its two monomers rendered it too expensive for any mass-market application [12–14]. When a biotechnology solution for producing a bio-based version of this monomer emerged, PTT, now in its bio-based form, was put back into consideration due to favorable economic factors, i.e., smart drop-in substitution. Finally, PLA ﬁber is a representative of novel products, with a “dedicated” production pathway [10] and no fossil-based counterpart. It is made of a homonymous polymer. It may be misleading to think that bio-based products are immune to the use of fossil resources since the approach concerns only the product’s mass without any other particular modiﬁcation in the supply chain (e.g., energy production, transportation). Bio-sourcing is not without risks either. Competition between food supply and biomass production, the over-exploitation of natural resources, and the loss of biodiversity are just a few of the possible undesired effects related to this strategy [15]. Whatever the case may be, whether bio-sourcing is a good solution for synthetics or not, the actual impacts of polyester substitution have not been studied abundantly to provide a conclusion. In order to obtain a more adequate and complete picture of the environmental impli- cations of such a solution, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied since it accounts for the aggregate environmental impacts of a product [16].

       " Document(page_content='assessment (LCA) methodology is applied since it accounts for the aggregate environmental impacts of a product [16]. All the resource consumption and environmental emissions from feedstock (cradle) to ﬁber (factory gate) are thereby accounted for. Thus far, published LCAs are in fact only indirectly related to polyester because its underlying polymer (PET) is well established in the plastics and pack- Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 3 of 19 aging sectors, driving bio-based innovation. As to our knowledge, there are no published LCAs on PLA or PTT ﬁbers available either. Thus far, published studies address bio-based PET and PTT monomers [17–22], bio-based PET polymer [23–27] or bio-based PET and PLA bottles [28–31]. While they act as very valuable proxies for an impact assessment and a degree of overlap indeed exists between the polymers and ﬁbers, further comparison to other synthetic or natural ﬁbers is not possible if studies stay on the lower product levels. Recent reviews found that LCA studies related to bio-based synthetics through the aforementioned proxies do not follow the same methodology (impact assessment method, inclusion of transport, etc.), have vastly different scopes (cradle-to-gate, cradle-to-grave, variant) and functional units, and are often fully aggregated and thus not entirely trans- parent [32,33]. Further, existing studies are found to focus mainly on the global warming potential (GWP) or fossil resource depletion, largely ignoring other environmental im- pacts [34]. In fact, the goal of the only paper related to bio-based polyester ﬁbers (including PET and PLA polymer) was to study GHG emissions and non-renewable energy use assuming incineration at the end of life [35]. On the topic of decreased climate impacts of bio-based products, Walker and Rothman [32] found that present LCAs have been favoring bio-based polymers by applying carbon crediting for the uptake of carbon (C) as carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air during feedstock growth. In the absence of immediate photosynthesis, a carbon credit is not applied to the fossil-based products since the method is founded on the so-called short C cycle (the uptake of the non-fossilized C from air). They point that carbon crediting is a “controversial and potentially misleading method when used in cradle-to-gate studies where the end of life emission of CO2 is not included”. If the end of life (EOL) is included, studies are found to report much higher GWP results for polymers than those which limit the scope to granulate, i.e., to the gate [34]. When only climate factors are accounted for, there is a great chance to miss adverse effects or trade-offs in other categories such as water consumption, eutrophication, acidiﬁ- cation, ecotoxicity, land use, etc., which may stem from the agricultural practices or the modiﬁed supply chains. Furthermore, an LCA study [25] that compared recycled PET and PLA polymers against the conventional PET in Europe found that recycled PET out- performs both counterparts. By examining 11 non-climate impacts in addition to climate change, the study found that the bio-based representative does not show clear environmen- tal advantages and that current European waste management practices strongly question its sustainability [25]. Given that melt spinning is the only step between polymers and synthetic ﬁbers in question, very close outcomes can be expected on the ﬁber level. Last but not least, in the absence of comprehensive LCA studies on the substitution of fossil-based ﬁbers by the bio-based alternatives, the political or corporate decisions of prioritizing bio-based ﬁbers and textiles over conventional ones stay without a scientiﬁc foundation. The present paper acts in this information vacuum and aims to shed light on the implications of bio-sourcing for polyester by performing a cradle-to-gate LCA on polyester ﬁber and its bio-based substitutes with varying levels of bio-content. By assessing a wide range of environmental impacts, the study revolves around two main hypotheses that: (i) bio-sourcing decreases the climate impacts of bio-based ﬁbers relative to fossil-based polyester as a consequence of omitted consumption of fossil-based feedstock; (ii) bio-sourcing simultaneously causes adverse effects in non-climate impacts of bio- based ﬁbers relative to the conventional polyester.

       " Document(page_content='The impact assessment was performed with the Environmental Footprint method and three adaptations on carbon crediting and distance-to-target weights (see Methods and Materials). This method was chosen as the future reference method of the European Union (EU) for the product’s environmental footprint while the EU’s bio-based policy is expected to drive the innovation for these and products alike. The results, therefore, enable institutional decision-makers, sustainability managers as well as the general public to grasp the environmental consequences of this well-intended strategy. To do so, the on-hand manuscript is structured in the following way: the ﬁrst part deﬁnes the goal and scope of this study and gives an overview of the methodology. The Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 4 of 19 prevailing production pathways on the market for each of the ﬁbers and their modeling are elaborated in the subsequent section. Finally, we present the most relevant results for each examined ﬁber and summarize the discussion of these results. 2. Materials and Methods This study performs a comparative LCA of polyester and three types of its substitutes with varying levels of bio-based content. It aims to identify the environmental advantages and disadvantages of the bio-sourcing of polyester and point to the most inﬂuential parameters for the environmental performance of bio-based alternatives (in the context of the European bio-based economy). The functional unit of comparison is 1 kg of ﬁber, ﬁnished, at factory gate, while the scope of the study is cradle-to-gate, i.e., from the primary inputs (crop or fossil-based compounds) to the ﬁnished ﬁber, at factory gate. Life cycle inventories were modeled based on state-of-the-art production processes (see chapter Production Pathways and Scenarios) for every ﬁber. Background data for this modeling were retrieved from the ecoinvent database, version 3.6 (recycled-content system model). The entire modeling was conducted in the software tool Simapro, version 9.1.1.1. For the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), the Environmental Footprint (EF) method as implemented in Simapro (i.e., “EF 3.0 Method (adapted), version 1.00”)—with its default characterization, normalization, and weighting factors—was applied in the first step (referred here as Default EF). However, the implementation of this method in Simapro does not account for biogenic CO2 uptake and emissions during the life cycle; therefore, a modified version of the said impact assessment method was applied to account for carbon sequestered from the atmosphere during crop growth. Modifications in characterization factors for climate change impacts for the uptake of CO2 from the air (factor -1 instead of 0), for biogenic emissions of CO2 (factor of 1 instead of 0), and for biogenic carbon monoxide emissions (factor of 1.57 instead of 0) were added. No other characterization factors, normalization or weighting parameters were modified. This Modified EF method, therefore, allowed us to determine the relevance of biogenic C net emissions in the production process of the fiber. Additionally, two more modiﬁed EF methods are produced by replacing the default weighting factors with distance-to-policy-target weights reported in Castellani et al. [36], which reﬂect the gap between the EU’s current and the desired state in environmental impacts. Amongst others, the importance of climate change decreases with these alternative target weights, while the relevance of factors such as ecotoxicity, eutrophication, and acidiﬁcation increases [36]. These modiﬁed methods allowed us to assess whether bio- based innovation was indeed aligned with the European environmental policy targets (binding and non-binding) as well as to perform a sensitivity analysis of our results. The impact assessment method where only these weights are changed is referred to as Default Castellani. Finally, the method where both elements, i.e., the characterization (same as in Modiﬁed EF) and the weighting factors, are modiﬁed is referred to as Modiﬁed Castellani. The characterization results are calculated for all 16 EF default impact categories included in this method. The single score results represent the aggregate scores after normalization and corresponding weighting and are expressed in points (Pt).

Production Pathways and Scenarios PET polymer is predominantly produced through the esteriﬁcation of monoethylene glycol (MEG) and puriﬁed terephthalic acid (PTA) according to Reaction 1 [17,37]. The two monomers are synthesized independently of each other and then brought together in a polymerization plant. n C2H6O4 (MEG) + n C8H6O4 (PTA) → C10H8O4 (PET) + 2n H2O (Reaction 1) Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 5 of 19 The production of fossil-based MEG and PTA is globally well-established. The tra- ditional production of MEG starts with ethylene derived from natural gas. Ethylene is oxidized into ethylene oxide and subject to hydrolysis to arrive to MEG [28]. All the production steps are enchained on the same production site. On the other hand, the main raw material for PTA, para-xylene, is obtained cheaply and in large quantities from the crude oil’s aromatic stream [17,24]. Para-xylene (PX) is subject to catalytic partial oxidation, after which the crude form of terephthalic acid is puriﬁed [17,18]. This process, also known as the Amoco process, is currently the leading technology for PTA production on a global scale with very high process efﬁciency parameters [17]. Reaction 1 does not depend on the origin of the monomers, and thus equally applies to the partially and fully bio-based PET production as well. Partial bio-content means that only one of the two monomers is derived from bio-based feedstock, while the other is taken from fossil resources. Monomers alone always stem from just one feedstock, making them either fully bio- or fossil-based. The bio-based C content of a polymer is then calculated as the weighted average of the C contents of the two monomers. Namely, as Reaction 1 demonstrates, MEG accounts for 20% of C content of PET, while the remaining 80% comes from PTA. Partially bio-based PET consists of bio-based MEG and fossil-based PTA, and therefore has 20% bio-based C content; the reverse combination of monomers is not known as of yet. PET can also be 100% bio-based when both monomers are derived from biogenic sources. In the case of bio-based MEG, instead of sourcing ethylene from the natural gas, it is obtained indirectly through bio-ethanol (see Figure 1). Bio-ethanol is industrially produced in the microbial fermentation of natural sugars present in sucrose (e.g., sugarcane) and starchy (e.g., corn) biomass, notably in the United States of America (USA) and Brazil [35,38]. The USA uses corn to produce 63% of the global bio-ethanol volumes, while Brazil uses sugarcane and accounts for 24% [35,38]. Second-generation feedstock for bio-ethanol production is yet to be commercialized [38] and as such is far from relevant industrial-scale production. Corn-based production predominantly uses the dry milling technology [39] in which starch is extracted from the corn grain and separated into glucose units. This simple sugar is then fermented and ethanol is distilled. Conversely, ethanol from sugarcane can be obtained in two modes—in direct fermentation of raw sugarcane with cogeneration (energy recovery) of lingo-cellulosic by-products [24]; or via fermentation of molasses, a by-product in sugar mills, where crystal sugar is extracted for human consumption. Regardless of the exact production method of ethanol, this compound is dehydrated into ethylene [40]. All the subsequent steps, downstream of ethylene, then mimic those of the petrochemical chain of MEG (see Figure 1). New pathways to produce PTA from diverse non-fossil sources have already been considered in the literature and practice [41]. The only industrial-scale production of PTA to date involves bio-sourced iso-butanol, which is converted into bio-PX using the Gevo process in a bio-reﬁnery in the USA [17,18]. Its production also requires the extraction of glucose from corn, followed by its fermentation into iso-butanol, conversion into iso- butylene, and several intermediary steps to arrive at the bio-PX [42]. Finally, the bio-based PX is converted into PTA using the Amoco process, just as for the conventional PX. PTT polymer is produced in an esteriﬁcation', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c4df95b8b4d51c396674df839961e3e041ed0ea.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Finally, the bio-based PX is converted into PTA using the Amoco process, just as for the conventional PX. PTT polymer is produced in an esteriﬁcation reaction between 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and PTA whose conditions are similar to PET polymerization [12,13]. n C3H8O2(PDO) + n C8H6O4 (PTA) → n C11H10O4 (PTT) + 2n H2O (Reaction 2) Monomers are again synthesized separately and brought together during the poly- merization. As attested by Reaction 2, PDO accounts for 27% of C in PTT. Depending on whether one or either monomer is bio-based, PTT can therefore have a bio-based C content of 27% (partially bio-based) or 100% (fully bio-based). Unlike PET, where the production of bio-MEG implies a change for the intermediary product, in PTT, fossil- and bio-based PDO have vastly different production pathways (see Figure 1). Fossil-based PDO used to be produced from ethylene via the Shell process [43,44]; however, such a monomer is no Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 6 of 19 longer commercially available due to the high costs of production [21]. For the production of bio-based PDO, only one fully commercialized route exists, i.e., the fermentation of corn-derived glucose for a direct production of bio-PDO using genetically engineered E. Coli [14,19,20,44]. Corn cultivation and glucose extraction via starch hydrolysis therefore precede bacterial fermentation [19,20] like in all other corn-based monomers. Appl.

Last but not least, PLA is a polymer with a 100% bio-based carbon content [26,45]. From the point of view of life sciences, PLA is a biopolymer, hence biodegradable [45,46]. As it does not have a fossil-based counterpart, it is classiﬁed as a novel/dedicated polymer [10] and a new generic ﬁber [4]. PLA is predominantly produced in ring-opening polymerization of lactides [47], used by NatureWorks in the USA, which is currently its most notable producer [26,48]. Here, corn-derived glucose is fermented into crude lactic acid by diverse bacteria; several continuous extraction and puriﬁcation steps are applied to obtain an aqueous polymer-grade lactic acid [26]. The acid is transformed into lactides followed by an open ring polymerization and pelletization by which PLA granulate is obtained [26,47]. As a ﬁnal step, conventional polyester ﬁbers are produced by melt spinning the PET granulate.

       " Document(page_content='As a ﬁnal step, conventional polyester ﬁbers are produced by melt spinning the PET granulate. Melt spinning is a thermo-mechanical, solvent-free process, possible only if the decomposition temperature of the polymer is above its melting point [12], which yields continuous or staple ﬁber (cut into predetermined length for a cotton-like ﬁber). Melt spinning can equally be applied on PTT and PLA polymers [13,45]. Based on the state-of-the-art production processes, and to account for different levels of bio-based content and feedstock, a total of seven different scenarios for PET ﬁber, two for PTT ﬁber and one for PLA ﬁber are modeled here as presented in Figure 1. Scenario 0 is the baseline scenario for fossil-based polyester; Scenarios 1, 2A, 2B combine the bio- Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 7 of 19 MEG and fossil-PTA; Scenarios 3, 4A, 4B combine the bio-MEG and bio-PTA; Scenario 5 combines bio-PDO and fossil-PTA; Scenario 6 combines bio-PDO and bio-PTA; Scenario 7 refers to PLA. Firstly, fossil-based MEG (Scenario 0) is derived from ethylene in existing produc- tion facilities around the world. All the steps from ethylene to MEG happen on one site. Its global production and transport are modeled using ecoinvent datasets without modiﬁcations. Further, three versions of bio-based MEG are modeled: • Bio-MEG derived from corn grain in the USA. The entire production from ethanol to MEG is assumed to happen on one production site. Ethanol is obtained using dry milling technology (for Scenarios 1 and 3). • Bio-MEG derived from sugarcane in Brazil. The ethanol is obtained in an autonomous plant in the direct fermentation of sugarcane, where bagasse is incinerated for energy recovery (for Scenarios 2A and 4A). • Bio-MEG derived from sugarcane in Brazil. The ethanol is obtained in an annexed plant through the fermentation of sugar molasses from the crystal sugar production (for Scenarios 2B and 4B). In all three versions, the dehydration of ethanol into ethylene is assumed based on [18,40]. The rest of the chain up to MEG and its transport is modeled in the same way as for the fossil-MEG, with appropriate modiﬁcations of inputs and biogenic emissions. Secondly, fossil-PTA is derived from para-xylene using the Amoco process in existing production facilities around the world. The extraction of PX and its transformation into PTA happen on the same site (for Scenarios 0, 1, 2A/B, 5). PTA’s global production and transport are modeled using ecoinvent datasets without modiﬁcations. Conversely, bio-PTA is produced from corn on one site in USA using the Gevo process. Iso-butanol fermentation and its transformation to iso-butylene are adapted from corn-to-ethanol and ethanol-to-ethylene (for MEG) processes using stoichiometric relations. The remainder of the chain up to bio-based PX is based on data from [18]. The transformation of PX into PTA is modeled as for fossil-PTA with appropriate input modiﬁcations and same transport. As for the PET polymerization, the same global facilities are assumed to be used for applicable bio- and fossil-based scenarios, both modeled with ecoinvent datasets (scenarios 0 to 4B). Bio-PDO is produced from corn in the USA (for Scenarios 5 and 6). Glucose extraction followed by fermentation is modeled using the data from [19–21]. PTT polymerization is adapted from PET polymerization using stoichiometric relations since the two reactions show a strong similarity (esteriﬁcation under similar conditions, water as a by-product, shared monomer) and a potential for retroﬁtting. PLA (Scenario 7) is obtained from corn in the USA; the entire corn-to-polymer produc- tion chain is modeled using an ecoinvent dataset. All polymers are transported to a fiber production site, modeled with PET polymer transport data from ecoinvent. Further, all are subject to melt spinning in order to produce the homonymous fiber in available fiber production facilities around the world. The melt spinning is modeled using the ecoinvent dataset on polyester production. More details on all datasets, approximations, and modifications can be found in the Supplementary Information. 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Feedstock Requirements As evidenced by the production pathways, current bio-based strategies follow par- ticular substitution approaches, all starting from ﬁrst-generation feedstock. In the case of bio-polyester ﬁbers, they displace the fossil-based intermediary products in established pro- duction pathways, namely ethylene and para-xylene,', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c4df95b8b4d51c396674df839961e3e041ed0ea.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of bio-polyester ﬁbers, they displace the fossil-based intermediary products in established pro- duction pathways, namely ethylene and para-xylene, by homologous alternatives derived from bio-feedstock. In doing so, they add production steps to derive the two compounds through fermentation and chemical modiﬁcation of an alcohol, while a substantial part of the chain follows without major modiﬁcations (e.g., Amoco process for PTA, ethylene- to-MEG, polymerization, melt spinning). In the case of PTT, an entirely new bio-based Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 8 of 19 path for PDO was developed using bacterial fermentation; ethylene for fossil-based PDO is not substituted simply because its conversion into PDO is ﬁnancially unattractive. In the case of PLA, its novelty does not permit a comparison with a pre-existing fossil-based counterpart, except that it too uses microbial fermentation. Under these conditions, modeled scenarios are shown to have vastly different feed- stock requirements, as shown in Table 1. Namely, in order to produce 1 kg of the conven- tional polyester, 0.199 kg of ethylene and 0.585 kg of para-xylene are needed. The two compounds are regarded as primary inputs, while additional inputs such as oxygen or water not listed here do not fall under the bio-based innovation (no C to replace). When crops displace these petrochemical inputs, the requirements for primary inputs are shown to rise substantially due to feedstock and process modiﬁcations. Table 1. Feedstock requirements for each scenario. Note that these results are independent of the impact assessment applied.

Moreover, corn-derived MEG is observed to have higher feedstock efﬁciency than the sugarcane-derived versions since it requires less feedstock than the other two variations. MEG from directly fermented ethanol has a higher sugarcane requirement than the one stemming from molasses. The latter comes from a by-product of crystal sugar extraction, which means that other products are extracted from the sugarcane mass in parallel; in the former case, after fermentation, the mass is burned for energy recovery. The feedstock requirements rise for fully bio-based scenarios, where they range from 1.53 to 6.43 kg crops/kg ﬁber. It should be noted that the present LCA only partially accounts for whether the crop is of natural or genetically modiﬁed (GMO) origin. Namely, in accounting for the spatial and mass distribution of global corn production, part of this feedstock grown in the USA is presumed to be GMO. This question remains of great relevance to public opinion. At this point, the contribution of feedstock to the aggregate environmental impacts of the ﬁber is not addressed, only the crop quantities. The latter will depend on the environmental intensity of said crops, i.e., how they are grown. Since agriculture is an environmentally intense activity, we explore the contribution of bio-based feedstock to different impact categories in sub-chapter 4.3 (Further Midpoint Categories). Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 9 of 19 4.2. Climate Change Impact Climate change impact (CCI) has the highest weight in the single score results of the EF impact assessment method, reﬂecting its relevance in the overall environmental narrative of the EU. For this reason, the results of climate change impacts are presented and discussed in the ﬁrst step of the assessment. Figure 2 shows the CCI results with the Default and the Modiﬁed EF, the latter of which incorporates biogenic C uptake and emissions (as described in Materials and Methods). Since Walker and Rothman [32] ﬁnd that presenting only the CCI results obtained with carbon crediting in a cradle-to-gate study is misleading, we also take the opportunity to not only explore the relevance of the biogenic C but address the issue of carbon crediting', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c4df95b8b4d51c396674df839961e3e041ed0ea.txt'}),\n",

Note that the difference between the dark and light bars for each scenario reflects the biogenic carbon embedded in the fiber. The relative change between the two results is therefore calculated as (modified − default)/default result and illustrates the impact of carbon crediting on climate change results. Figure 2. Climate change impacts calculated with Default EF (darker bars) and Modiﬁed EF (lighter bars) methods. Note that the difference between the dark and light bars for each scenario reﬂects the biogenic carbon embedded in the ﬁber. The relative change between the two results is therefore calculated as (modiﬁed − default)/default result and illustrates the impact of carbon crediting on climate change results. When Default EF is applied (i.e., darker bars in Figure 2), only three scenarios (2A, 2B, 7) are shown to perform within a ±10% range of the conventional polyester, which is associated with 4.07 kg CO2 eq./kg ﬁber. All other scenarios far surpass the baseline, rising up to 7.13 kg CO2 eq./kg ﬁber for bio-based polyester derived from corn. Except in the case of PLA ﬁber, CCI is found to rise with the bio-content. Contrary to it, Modiﬁed EF (i.e., lighter bars in Figure 2) leads to a completely different conclusion on the bio-based ﬁbers as all perform notably better than the conventional polyester. Unlike 4.10 kg CO2 eq./kg polyester, bio-based ﬁbers are shown to have emis- sions as low as 1.54 kg CO2 eq./kg ﬁber when crediting is applied. Furthermore, CCI decreases with the increasing bio-based content. Namely, when comparing the correspond- Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 10 of 19 ing partially and fully bio-based scenarios (1 vs. 3, 2A vs. 4A, 2B vs. 4B, 5 vs. 6), the latter display lower climate impacts; between these scenarios, we observe that CCI decreases from 32 to 41% by substituting not only MEG/PDO but PTA as well. Regardless of the method, we observe that Scenario 1 with a corn-derived MEG has a higher climate impact than the sugar-derived ones (2A, 2B). In comparison, such a conclusion is consistent with the ﬁnding of Shen et al.; in their cradle-to-grave study on GHG emissions, they identiﬁed that partially bio-based PET polymer from corn has higher climate results than the one from sugarcane [35]. Moreover, Anex and Ogletree [19] had found that partially bio-based PTT polymer (here comparable to Scenario 5) has emissions of 4.1 kg CO2 eq./kg polymer. Indeed, our Default EF calculations point to a comparable level of emissions (4.71 kg CO2 eq./kg ﬁber) for Scenario 5. Finally, Vink et al. showed that NatureWorks’ brand of PLA polymer emits 3.2 kg CO2 eq./kg polymer without and 1.3 kg CO2 eq./kg polymer with carbon crediting [27]. Their results are equally in the range of ours, as we add the melt spinning. Furthermore, on the topic of two impact methods, darker bars in Figure 2 reﬂect the fossil-based process emissions in the production chain of ﬁbers. The difference between darker and corresponding lighter bars highlights the role of CO2 sequestered from the atmosphere via crops’ photosynthesis. The gap is thus displaying the carbon capture since the sequestered C eventually ends up embedded in ﬁber mass. The extent of this effect is portrayed by the relative change where we see the resulting decrease in emissions. The lighter bars hence represent net CO2 eq. including all emissions and when this uptake is taken into account. Present cradle-to-gate LCA, however, cannot account for what happens to the embed- ded C at the end of life. In theory, all this C (i.e., fossil-based and bio-based) is released back into the atmosphere at the end of life; as Hottle et al. [34] suggest the extension of the scope to the grave would inherently increase the net CO2 emissions relative to the present study. Accounting for the EOL of ﬁbers is, therefore, possible through scope expansion and adding grave variants speciﬁc to the individual waste management systems. Due to the high variability of these systems, different material properties are desirable under different local circumstances and, as such, they inﬂuence the aggregate climate impact of the ﬁbers.

       " Document(page_content='material properties are desirable under different local circumstances and, as such, they inﬂuence the aggregate climate impact of the ﬁbers. If there exists an incineration facility for heat and energy recovery, then a ﬁber with higher energy content per kg is more desirable (PET or PTT). If only composting or digestion are available in local circumstances, a biodegradable product such as PLA might be preferred over the other, non-biodegradable alternatives. If all textile waste ends up landﬁlled, biodegradable ﬁber may be the worst option due to the anaerobic conditions causing the production of methane in the body of landﬁll, which is far more potent than CO2 in terms of climate impacts. The ﬁnal effects of applied EOL solutions on the environmental performance of ﬁbers remain to be investigated. Finally, since the EOL of textile products (of which ﬁbers are a part) is not accounted for at present, our results should be interpreted solely in a way to understand the relevance of C uptake to these bio-based ﬁbers. Conversely, as Figure 2 shows, carbon crediting alone can artiﬁcially decrease the climate impact results by up to 70% and misportray the climate impacts of the substitutes, especially knowing that effective emission will rise when the scope is enlarged. 4.3. Further Midpoint Categories In addition to climate change, all 15 other impacts were examined in the impact assess- ment. Since carbon crediting affects only the emissions related to climate change, results for the remaining 15 categories are the same regardless of whether the applied EF method is modiﬁed or default. Here, 8 out of 15 most relevant categories are discussed in detail, while the remainder, which have low normalization results, can be found in Supporting information. Due to low relevance for the bio-based economy, the use of metal and mineral resources is, however, not elaborated here. Conversely, despite low normalization results, land use was still included due to its relevance in the bio-based economy in terms of Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 11 of 19 agricultural surface needs. Note that any change in all the aforementioned impacts relative to Scenario 0 is still accounted for with upcoming single scores. The said results are found to largely depend on the bio-content and crop choice. As to the former, the gravity of acidiﬁcation, all three eutrophication categories, ecotoxicity, water use, and land use generally increases with the bio-content, as attested by Figure 3. As to the latter, partially bio-based polyesters derived from sugarcane have the lowest results in acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, ecotoxicity and water use and are largely comparable to those of polyester. Notably, the scenarios (2A, 2B) with MEG derived from sugarcane outperform those with MEG stemming from corn (3). To recall, scenarios 2A and 2B have or stem from a useful by-product in sugar/ethanol production (bagasse and molasses), which results in shared environmental burdens among the main and by-products. Moreover, out of all scenarios, fully bio-based scenarios have the worst impact results in acidiﬁcation, eutrophication categories, ecotoxicity, water use as well as land use. Finally, the use of fossil resources does not decrease substantially, nor enough to balance out the increase in other impacts. For 8 out of 9 scenarios, fossil resource use is within 85% of the fossil consumption of conventional polyester. Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20 Figure 3.

       " Document(page_content='LCA has found that bio-based PET polymer, derived from sugarcane (comparable to Scenario 2B), has a eutrophication potential of 0.179 g P/kg polymer [24]. In our case, including melt spinning, the result for Scenario 2B amounts to 0.174 kg P eq./kg ﬁber. Furthermore, a recent study [25] found that freshwater and marine eutrophication increase 1.8 and 3.2 times, respectively, during manufacturing when switching from PET polymer to PLA. In our case, the increases amount to 3 times for freshwater and 2.2 times for marine eutrophication when comparing the PLA ﬁber (Scenario 7) to polyester (Scenario 0). The primary difference between our setups is that the said study [25] does not incorporate the transport and is elaborated on the polymer level for Europe only. Freshwater ecotoxicity impacts for bio-based ﬁbers resemble those of freshwater eutrophication. Corn-based bio-polyester (Scenario 3) has the poorest ecotoxicity proﬁle, its result being 4.9 times higher than Scenario 0. Corn agriculture is characterized by the notable use of pesticides such as glyphosate or atrazine, which contribute substantially to ecotoxicity proﬁles (high characterization factors). Moreover, as part of the modeled corn comes the genetically modiﬁed spectrum, and the use of pesticides is even more prominent and negatively affects the environmental impacts. Furthermore, the acidiﬁcation potential increases with bio-content up to 3.2 times relative to Scenario 0. As the only recent point of reference, a study [25] also found that the acidiﬁcation potential of PLA polymer increases 1.76 times relative to fossil-based PET. In our study, we ﬁnd 1.3 times the difference between the two comparable ﬁbers. The production of conventional polyester is found to require 1.972 m3 water/kg ﬁber. Partially bio-based ﬁbers derived from sugarcane have a comparable water requirement, while other bio-based scenarios require 2.3 to 7.1 times more. Fully corn-based ﬁbers have the worst water impact proﬁle. Land use in bio-based ﬁbers increases the most of all other impacts, as seen in Figure 3; bio-based ﬁbers require 6 to 27 times more land for their production than the conventional polyester. Even though the share of agricultural land consumption which falls speciﬁcally on ﬁber production can be regarded as small, switching other products to bio-based alternatives will put additional stress on the available land as evident from this example. There are two major implications associated with increased land requirements—land clearing and biodiversity loss, as well as feedstock competition. Firstly, if requirements are not met by the historically cleared land, the destruction of intrinsically richer ecosystems such as forests or rainforests is foreseeable and leads to irreparable loss of biodiversity [15] in order to make a place for intensive monoculture. Amongst other ecological services such as land erosion prevention, forests are also a major carbon sink; therefore, their clearing has negative climate implications. This is increasingly important for one of the crops of choice—sugarcane grown in Brazil, where regions are particularly susceptible to deforestation to make space for the intensive agriculture. The more bio-based products are put on the market, the more ﬁrst-generation feedstock is required. In the case of limited land availability, feedstock competition may be provoked as the same crops end up as non- edible products instead of as a source of food. Indirect and direct land use are, therefore, an important part of the bio-based economy with substantial ramiﬁcations that should be addressed in more detail before bolder bio-based innovation steps are taken. Our discussion of bio-based ﬁbers, which rely on agriculture, is complemented with an assessment of feedstock contribution (agriculture and transport) to the eight non- climate impact categories. Figure 4 shows that the feedstock determines a big part of the ﬁbers’ impacts. Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 13 of 19 Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 20 Figure 4.

Contribution of feedstock (agriculture and transport) to the resulting impacts of fibers. Note that 100% of each impact stands for the resulting impact of the fiber in question. Feedstock contributions were calculated for each scenario as (impact of the crop as per Default EF method x feedstock requirement per kg of fiber)/impact of the fiber as per Default EF method. In most of the impacts elaborated here, Scenarios 2A and 2B are an exception to the rule. Not only do they display lower absolute impact results relative to other scenarios, but the contribution of sugarcane is also less notable than in other cases, due to the sharing of environmental burdens as explained. The relevance of feedstock in acidiﬁcation, eutrophi- cation (all three types), and ecotoxicity rises with bio-content. Terrestrial eutrophication is affected by feedstock the most—from 43% to 71% is directly tied to feedstock. Crops also account for 50–85% of water use, as a direct consequence of intensive agriculture. Land use is heavily governed by crop needs, as more than 80% of land requirements of the ﬁber production falls on feedstock. Finally, the results on the use of fossil resources indicate that a bulk of oil and gas consumption happens during the transformation and production processes, rather than at the feedstock stage. 4.4. Single Score Results The aggregate environmental impacts of the ﬁber were examined through single scores. The results that bring all 16 impact categories together were produced with Default EF and are presented in Figure 5. When all the impacts are addressed jointly, it is shown that only partially bio-based polyesters derived from sugarcane (Scenarios 2A/2B) and PLA ﬁber (Scenario 7) have comparable performance to conventional polyester. Their Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 14 of 19 single score results are in the ±10% range from the said baseline. Conversely, conventional polyester outperforms all other bio-based alternatives, notably all fully bio-based ones just like elaborated midpoint scores had shown. Fully bio-based polyester made from corn (Scenario 3) is characterized by the most substantial increase in environmental impact relative to polyester. Appl.

The aggregate environmental impact of polyester and its bio-based substitutes. The results refer to single scores obtained with Default EF method. The choice of the crop has a decisive impact on the aggregate performance of the ﬁber, owing to their different environmental intensities. Corn-derived ﬁbers have a higher overall environmental impact relative to the corresponding sugar-derived ones as Scenarios 1 and 2A/2B show. Here, only MEG is substituted with a bio-based form, making sugarcane a better alternative than corn for MEG sourcing. Bio-based PTA is found to have a poorer performance relative to the fossil-based version of the monomer. Due to its relevance for the bio-based C content of the polyester and PTT ﬁbers (80% and 73% C content), the environmental performance of these bio-based ﬁbers hinges on the development of the environmentally sound bio-PTA. On the side of LCA, it should be noted that the modeling of PTA is subject to many approximations, and to increase the accuracy, bio-PTA assessment necessitates either on-site process data or modeling in chemical engineering software. As it stands at present, an increase in the bio-based content is shown to have an adverse effect on the aggregate environmental performance of the bio-based ﬁbers in question.

Furthermore, the lighter colored bars in Figure 6 represent the results obtained with the Modiﬁed EF method. Three substitute scenarios (2A, 2B, 7) are again shown to have comparable performance to conventional polyester. The remaining bio-based scenarios again show a poorer overall environmental performance, with an increase in the bio-based content resulting in a bigger gap between the two methods. For each scenario, the entire score gap between modiﬁed and default EF results stems from the difference in the climate impacts due to carbon crediting. Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 15 of 19 Figure 5.

Sensitivity analysis of single score results with distance-to-target (Castellani) weights. The results refer to single scores obtained with Default EF (darker bars), Modified EF (lighter bars), Default Castellani (line), Modified Castellani (triangle) methods. As a ﬁnal step, in order to corroborate that non-climate impacts of ﬁbers are highly relevant to the overall environmental performance, we performed a sensitivity analysis of single scores. We applied European distance-to-policy-target weighting factors for the Default Castellani and the Modiﬁed Castellani methods (see Materials and Methods). Notably, we ﬁnd that trends stay largely the same—bio-content in linked to poorer performance of the bio-based ﬁbers, while the gravity of the performance gap increases. Distance-to-target weights show that when climate change is given less priority, the aggregate impacts of the bio-based ﬁbers in fact increase, which demonstrates that the substitution of polyester by bio-based alternatives goes against achieving environmental targets of the EU. The reduction in carbon footprint which is achieved through bio-sourcing (and shown through the bar difference) applies only in circular economy systems, where material recycling, product durability, and increased life span will sustain the carbon reduction over a longer period until EOL management. In European countries, incineration for energy recovery is a highly plausible scenario for a wide array of textile products, whereby bio-C ends up in the atmosphere as CO2 after burning. The ﬁnal climate performance of intermediaries such as ﬁbers is contingent on the textile products which they form. Notably, in the case of durable, long-life textile products (e.g., carpets), the carbon in the bio-based product’s structure is released back into the atmosphere further down the timeline. These products may therefore bring the beneﬁt of carbon capture. Conversely, when ﬁbers form fast fashion products, this is lost due to the associated short use and fast disposal. All the C is rapidly released back into the atmosphere without a “grace period” on carbon emissions. Considering that polyester is a ﬁber inherently linked to fast fashion [49], the examined bio-based substitutes are likely to serve in fast fashion applications. Consequently, their climate impacts have to be interpreted in accordance with their future application. As for recycling, by keeping these products in a closed-loop system, life is inevitably prolonged. In the textile sector, the mechanical recycling of conventional as well as drop-in polyester ﬁbers in closed loop is not common. In fact, current recycled polyester is a method of down-cycling PET bottles; therefore, conventional recycled polyester itself presents the second life of PET. In the case of the recycling of substitute ﬁbers, if the efforts of their Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 16 of 19 recycling are too high, then the impacts of closed loops can end up being negative.

At present, we do not dispose of enough evidence on the burdens of polyester recycling. Further, on the topic of recycling and circular economy, the present LCA does not fully cover the issues of public perception, corporate communication, or greenwashing. The term “bio” was shown to be innately associated with a better environmental performance of the products [32] even though our results point to different conclusions. People may as- sociate “bio-based” with a long-term solution to the textile waste problem and microplastic pollution, the effects of which have not yet been investigated. Not all bio-based textiles are biodegradable, nor does the reverse apply. Even when a product has the potential of being biodegradable (PLA), whether it actually does will depend on a number of environmen- tal conditions and the waste management facilities. After all, bio-based synthetic ﬁbers remain synthetics, requiring chemical engineering to convert the feedstock, whatever the perception around them may be. 5. Conclusions The here summarized project performed a comparative LCA of fossil-based polyester (originating from fossil-based PET) and its bio-based substitutes—i.e., bio-polyester (drop- in), PTT ﬁber (smart drop-in), and PLA ﬁber (novel). All of the aforementioned ﬁbers are produced here by melt spinning the homonymous polymers. Currently, all state-of- the-art production processes of these bio-based substitutes use ﬁrst-generation feedstock, i.e., crops, predominantly corn and sugarcane. Production pathways of bio-based and fossil-based PET and PTT are found to have signiﬁcant overlaps, which is a strong point for the use and retroﬁtting of the existing production capacities. As for the impact assessment, several common trends are observed across all presently examined ﬁbers. Only three out of nine substitutes are found to be in the range of polyester, based on the overall scores (Default EF). The remainder offer no real environmental advan- tage since single scores are higher than for the incumbent. Moreover, the performance of bio-polyester and PTT ﬁbers is shown to be strongly inﬂuenced by the proﬁle of bio-PTA since this monomer accounts for a prevailing part of their C contents. More accurate modeling of PTA is therefore necessary for the future. We ﬁnd that conclusions on climate results signiﬁcantly depend on whether carbon crediting is applied or not. Climate impacts decrease for the same ﬁber up to 70% when biogenic carbon is accounted for. However, for this reduction to hold in the long(er) term, circular economy principles are mandatory. Otherwise, carbon crediting may end up as a method that artiﬁcially reduces the climate impacts of bio-based products as previously suggested. We also show that highly relevant impacts for all examined bio-based ﬁbers are acidiﬁcation, eutrophication (terrestrial, marine, freshwater), ecotoxicity, land and water use. Their impacts are found to rise with an increasing bio-content, while a sizeable part of the aforementioned impacts is directly linked to the used feedstock. Our study thus conﬁrms that the adverse effects of bio-sourcing on non-climate impact categories are overlooked if not accounted for. Finally, the consumption of fossil resources is shown to drop only slightly relative to conventional polyester, by which we also show that the fossil- fuel dependency of the process chain does not decrease simply by a change to bio-based starting materials. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of bio-sourcing, we identify three major options—search for other functional substitutes of polyester, revert to feedstock diversiﬁcation or improve the agricultural practices. In the ﬁrst case, other bio-based ﬁbers with favorable material properties should be considered, e.g., polyethylene furanoate. In the second case, the so-called second-generation feedstock should be considered and involves lingo-cellulosic waste and products such as wood mass, stalks, leaves, etc. As of yet, all the processes using such feedstock are only at the very beginning of development, and it will take signiﬁcant time to catch up with present processes, based on ﬁrst feedstock generation. In the last case, the environmental intensity of agriculture is to be mitigated by reducing the use and pollution of water and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, all of which Appl. Sci.', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c4df95b8b4d51c396674df839961e3e041ed0ea.txt'}),\n",

Sci. 2021, 11, 2993 17 of 19 are linked with acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, and ecotoxicity. While the ﬁrst strategy may have positive consequences on the plastic and textiles sectors, the mitigation of agricultural impacts should have a spill-over effect on all domains of the bio-based economy. In summary, taking into account the constraint of this research and the currently available technologies, this project identiﬁed important implications for bio-based textiles. Bio-based alternatives are found to be environmentally uncompetitive with conventional polyester. When European distance-to-target weights are applied, bio-based products are found to be counterproductive in mitigating environmental impacts. From a strictly envi- ronmental perspective, moving to bio-based synthetics still asks for several optimizations and improvements. As long as they stay predominantly “agro-based”, their use as “green” substitutes for polyester is scientiﬁcally unfounded.

However, social marketing scholars have struggled with guiding social marketers in conceptualising the social good and with defining who decides what is socially beneficial in different contexts. In this paper, we suggest that many dilemmas in identifying the social good in social marketing could be addressed by turning to human rights principles, and, in particular, by following a human rights-based approach. We examine a number of cross-cutting human rights principles – namely, transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination, and participation and inclusion – that are capable, in a practical way, of guiding the work of social marketers. Through an illustrative case study of the anti-obesity discourse, we present how these principles might help to address some of the challenges facing social marketing, both as a theory and practice, in meeting its definitional characteristic.

Despite efforts so far, no satisfactory understanding of the social good, and no practical guide for identifying the social good in social marketing, have been developed. As social marketing aims are never ethically neutral, calls have been made to advance what Brenkert (2008) describes as a theory of the social good that would be capable of guiding the practice of social marketing and of providing “criteria and standards for individual and social welfare” that social marketers should follow (ibid., p. 213). In an attempt to inform the ongoing work, we reflect on recent efforts to conceptualise the social good by drawing on the human rights discourse. We propose an approach founded on a set of core human rights principles that can guide conceptualisation of the social good in social marketing. We acknowledge that social marketing is a complex process that can give rise to ethical, political and moral (among other) questions, and in this paper we focus on one aspect in particular: the potential relevance of the human rights discourse in assisting social marketing in efforts to determine the social good. In this study, we are not focusing on human rights as an exclusively legal regime (i.e. human rights law) – furthermore, the relationship between (social) marketing and the law has been examined extensively by others (see, e.g., Rothschild, 1999; Taylor and Singleton, 1993) – but rather on the wider human rights discourse that encompasses multiple moral, ethical and legal considerations of rules and processes.

       " Document(page_content='and legal considerations of rules and processes. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper to the social marketing body of knowledge is that it provides a critical analysis of the potential interrelatedness between social marketing and human rights in an attempt to develop a human rights-based approach that could guide social marketers in conceptualising the social good in social marketing. Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 5 The paper starts by providing an overview of the key debates in three foundational concepts: social marketing, the social good and human rights. Then, a human rights-based approach is introduced to explore the nexus between social marketing and human rights discourses through a common platform of the social good. In line with Brenkert’s (2008) argument that the ethical dimension and the moral nature of social marketing is best addressed by engaging in in-depth discussions about social marketing activities, we provide an illustrative case study that allows us to explore the potential for a human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing. We focus on the anti-obesity discourse and its criticisms to examine the challenges social marketing faces and how these challenges can be addressed through an application of a human rights-based approach. Finally, concluding thoughts are offered, and we identify the key contributions, both theoretical and practical, of the human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing, and further highlight why and how social marketing can benefit from an approach to the social good based on human rights principles. Social marketing Established in the early 1970s, social marketing is a relatively young discipline focused on the application of marketing principles to foster social change (e.g., Lefebvre, 2011; Wymer, 2011). A broader history of social marketing’s origins and development has recently been offered elsewhere (see, e.g., Dibb, 2014), emphasising the need for the social marketing field to consider its future as a legitimate and independent discipline, beyond its initial status as a mere framework or structure (Kotler and Zaltman, 1971). Thus, early on, the future of social marketing as a distinct discipline was perceived to be dependent on its ability to define its boundaries (Luck, 1974), and, ever since, the debate about what constitutes social marketing as a concept has been evolving (see, e.g., Luca et al. [2015] for recent work on a service- Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 6 dominant approach to social marketing). In 2013, the International Social Marketing Association (ISMA), European Social Marketing Association (ESMA), and Australian Association of Social Marketing (AASM) adopted a consensus definition of social marketing, stating that “social marketing seeks to develop and integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to influence behaviours that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good” (AASM, ESMA, ISMA, 2013: para. 1). This definition prescribes that social marketing practice is “guided by ethical principles” in an attempt to bring about “social change programmes that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable” (ibid: para. 2). Unsurprisingly, the fundamental feature of the majority of social marketing definitions is their emphasis on the social good, even though this emphasis appears in different forms in many of these definitions (see, e.g., Dann, 2010; French and Blair-Stevens, 2006; Kotler and Lee, 2008; Kotler and Zaltman, 1971; Lefebvre, 2011). However, the social good has been explicitly considered only in a handful of social marketing studies (e.g. Brenkert 2002 and 2008; Gordon and Gurrieri, 2014; Gurrieri et al., 2014; Spotswood et al., 2012). The notion of the social good as the underlying motivation is key in the theory and practice of social marketing because it is the core identifier that distinguishes social marketing from other marketing activities. Thus, even though commercial and social marketing might share the same marketing toolkit, social marketing aims to enhance the social good, rather than profits. We recognise that although commercial marketing remains an important element of the social context (Hastings and Saren, 2003), the purpose of social', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"We recognise that although commercial marketing remains an important element of the social context (Hastings and Saren, 2003), the purpose of social marketing is to compensate for the deficiencies of commercial marketing with more socially responsible outcomes (Arnold and Fisher, 1996) – i.e. working towards the social good. However, it is beyond the scope of this paper to engage in a critical social marketing debate that has been explored elsewhere (Gordon, 2011; Gordon et al., 2010). Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 7 Despite commonalities, raisons d'être for commercial and social marketing differ. Commercial marketing’s approach to ethics provides rather a narrow view of social problems as it is driven by consumer orientation (Witkowski, 2007), making ethical and moral problems a consumer concern (Peattie and Peattie, 2003), which does not necessarily lead to consumer welfare in a social marketing sense. For example, for individuals who are informed about the consequences of smoking, maintaining the habit may be an expression of civil liberty (Chapman, 2008; Crotty Alexander and Malhotra, 2015); yet, in social marketing smoking and its social costs need to be considered in a broader public heath context (Jha and Peto, 2014). Thus, the dangers of over-relying on commercial marketing principles and practices in social marketing are particularly conspicuous in the area of public health, where social marketing faces ethical challenges that are far more complex than those of commercial marketing (Peattie and Peattie, 2003). Consequently, as also argued by Holden and Cox (2013a), the view that social marketing does not need to examine its main reason for existence – that is, the social good – is untenable. Although definitions of social marketing appear to be very appealing in their simplicity and all-encompassing nature, they nevertheless present certain challenges to social marketers. For example, while Dann (2010) acknowledges that the goals of social marketing are inherently subjective and political in nature and, hence, the aims of social marketing campaigns are defined by the people and organisations behind them, Donovan (2011) trusts in a common- sense understanding of the social good and, in case of any doubts, recommends relying on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as a guiding tool. The UDHR was adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1948 and, in its Preamble and 30 articles, it sets forth the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all are entitled without discrimination. Stemming from this advisory declaration, the International Bill of Human Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 8 Rights has evolved, including international treaties that directly create legal obligations for states, and it has provided a foundation for the human rights framework encompassing specific (legally enforceable) rights, as well as basic principles that are part of human rights standards and implementation (as we later discuss in more detail). Unsurprisingly, then, in the introduction to their Principles and Practice of Social Marketing, Donovan and Henley (2010: xv) invest the UDHR with the role of “the authoritative source for defining what constitutes a socially desirable goal”, suggesting that, in times of uncertainty, social marketers should rely on the UDHR in their attempts to clarify what the social good is (2010: 209). Even though the reality might be more complex than the idea that the UDHR simply acts as “one arbiter of the social good” (Donovan, 2011: 10), the proposition is a welcome advancement in the social marketing field as, first and foremost, it affirms the importance of the social good in and for social marketing. As also noted by some other scholars, the UDHR is a good starting point for crafting professional codes of conduct to guide those involved in developing or commissioning social marketing interventions (Spotswood et al., 2012: 170). We attempt, therefore, to expand upon this notion by identifying opportunities for social marketing to reach out to human rights scholarship and practice for guidance in relation to the social good and, consequently, to advance the debate on the social good in the context of social marketing theory and practice.

It must be acknowledged from the outset that it might be impractical, and also beyond the scope of every social marketing practitioner’s work, to engage in deep considerations of what constitutes socially desirable goals in each and every context; nevertheless, some of the concerns behind the socially responsible inducement of behaviour change must be addressed before engaging in programmes and actions that aim to achieve “the greater social good” (AASM, ESMA, ISMA, 2013, para. 1). Without some further in-depth examination of what Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 9 constitutes the social good, in what circumstances the social good would be determined as such, and as defined by whom, social marketing might not be able to progress as a discipline and overcome some of the major criticisms it faces. Such criticisms include assertions that social marketing is essentially manipulative, expensive and unethical (Andreasen, 2002; Brenkert, 2002), paternalistic (Donovan and Henley, 2010), or a form of social control (Cherrier and Gurrieri, 2014) that leads to negative consequences such as stigmatisation and social exclusion (Gurrieri et al., 2013), thereby infringing on the rights and freedoms of individuals (Holden and Cox, 2013b), or else being used in developing countries in a way that resembles the language and practices of the colonial era (Grier and Bryant, 2005). Despite the rise of critical social marketing focusing the debate on its social consequences (Gordon, 2011; Hastings and Saren, 2003), there is still a conspicuous absence of social marketing’s engagement with what Brenkert (2002) describes as one of the key ethical challenges in social marketing; that is, its ends. While the technical aspects of social marketing have been, and still are, widely debated in the literature (see, e.g., Andreasen, 2002; Peattie and Peattie, 2003; Tapp and Spotswood, 2013; Wood 2008), what constitutes a social problem and how the social good should be defined remains an underexplored and taken-for-granted area of social marketing (Brenkert, 2008). If social marketers are to facilitate well-being and social welfare, rather than to act merely as “behaviour change technicians” (Lefebvre, 2011), these key challenges necessitate an even greater need for enhancing engagement to explore the meaning and the nature of the social good in social marketing deliberations. Social good Commitment to the social good, and what it may constitute in different contexts, is a familiar Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 10 debate, but one that has not been solved, nor is it close to being solved (Brenkert, 2002 and 2008; Holden and Cox, 2013b; Kymlicka, 1988). Brenkert (2008), in his work on marketing ethics, cites Robin and Reidenbach, who argue that “the direct application of popular moral philosophies such as deontology or utilitarianism to ethical questions in marketing falls short of providing necessary guidance for marketers” (Robin and Reidenbach, 1993: 97). The very issue raised by Brenkert, Robin and Reidenbach has been identified as problematic in the wider social marketing literature that explores ethics as a means of interpreting the social good in social marketing. The work of Gurrieri et al. (2014) demonstrates the dichotomy between the different ethical positions, whereby some of the utilitarian principles (e.g. the greatest good for the greatest number of people) serve to harm those who do not comply with the dominant norms promoted by social marketing, leading to further stigmatisation and exclusion. Spotswood et al. also question some of the ethical implications of social marketing techniques, such as coercion, and call for developing ethical social marketing principles that would help social marketers establish “a balance between our power to change people and the legitimate demands of ethical transparency” (2012: 167). Although their work raises several important ethical questions, Spotswood et al. do not provide much guidance on what the ethical principles for social marketing practice should be.

       " Document(page_content='marketing practice should be. Whilst not denying the complexity of the task, Gordon and Gurrieri (2014) take the debate of ethical challenges a step further, and in their criticism of social marketing they argue that introducing reflexivity to social marketing may help to reduce the impact of unintended consequences such as stigmatisation and exclusion of individuals and groups. Thus, acknowledging the importance of ethics in social marketing, we attempt to address Gurrieri et al.’s call for a “more nuanced engagement with ethical perspectives and social justice principles” (2014: 535). To that end, the matter of (shared) values and understanding of the social good is considered Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 11 to be of utmost importance for developing cohesive communities and even entire nations, yet it has been largely dominated by the dichotomised ideological debate between liberalism, promoting principles such as equality, individual autonomy, liberty and free trade (and libertarianism/classical liberalism, which further advocates for a limited role of the government in realising these principles) and communitarianism, emphasising the importance of the community (for further discussion see, e.g., Avineri and De-Shalit, 1992). Since the mid-nineteenth century, when a social philosophy of communitarianism started to take shape, the focus has been on societal formulation of the good; this can be contrasted with classical liberalism’s stance, arguing it is up to each individual to formulate the good. The prevailing needs of the individual and the role of choice and freedom from state interference in an individual’s life, as embedded in libertarianism (see, e.g., Nozick, 1974), compete with the priorities of the social realm, as advocated by Communitarians (e.g. Ehrenhalt, 1995; see also Hofstede, 2001). While Libertarians see the greatest good in the availability of choice being given to individuals without judging the value of any of the preferences, providing everyone with the opportunity to become the person they want to be (Kymlicka, 1988), for Communitarians individuals exist within a community and therefore communal values are the greatest social good that needs to be supported by the state. It is not necessarily the case that liberal scholars have not seen the value in, or have not recognised, the importance of the socially embedded self, and as the American liberal theorist John Rawls asserts: “only in a social union is the individual complete” (Rawls, 1971: n4/525); however, the relationship between the individual and the community has been continuously complicated. In a wide variety of areas, Communitarians see the need for certain measures, including state regulation, to enhance social good. On the contrary, Libertarians perceive regulation as intrinsically paternalistic and not in conformity with their minimalist view of the role of the Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 12 state; that is simply to secure individual rights and freedoms. Again, it is not that Libertarians reject all forms of paternalism, as some would accept state paternalism to protect and promote liberty (see Vallentyne, 2007); however, as John Stuart Mill contends: “the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any one of their number, is self- protection…the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant” (1859: 21-22). There are different forms of paternalism, including ‘soft’ or ‘hard’, ‘broad’ or ‘narrow’, ‘moral’ or ‘welfare’ and many others, which exist on a wide spectrum of what is largely defined as any intervention in private decision-making. However, in essence, the libertarian approach negates interference with individual choices, as it is incompatible with individual liberty, freedom and autonomy. Communitarians challenge the libertarian approach to non- interference on the grounds that personal preferences are more than merely a reflection of the individual self, but also of the larger culture; and, within that larger culture, people are already heavily influenced by various factors,', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of the individual self, but also of the larger culture; and, within that larger culture, people are already heavily influenced by various factors, including commercial marketing. In an attempt to reconcile what otherwise seems to be irreconcilable – that is to make people to act in their best interest and, at the same time, to preserve liberal principles such as self- determination – Thaler and Sunstein (2003 and 2008) advocate liberal paternalism,i which forms also the theoretical foundation of nudging (see French, 2011 and Spotswood et al., 2012 for a discussion of nudging in social marketing). Deriving from psychology and behavioural economics, the Thaler and Sunstein model of liberal paternalism is rationalised on the bases that people have self-control problems (2003: 176). Thaler and Sustain see some Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 13 form of paternalism unavoidable as people are subject to various cognitive biases and their decisions are in any case influenced by external factors such as commercial marketing. What they therefore defend is paternalism that does not involve coercion or removal of personal choice but rather focuses on engineering of choice architecture: the design and presentation of choices to consumers (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008: 3-7). It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully engage in the debate on the nature and potential scope of liberal paternalism. That said, even though liberal paternalism proposes “an approach that preserves freedom of choice … [while] authorize[ing] both private and public institutions to steer people in directions that will promote their welfare” (Thaler and Sunstein, 2003: 179), it is not without its own limitations. For example, liberal paternalism permits the state to take on the interventionist role (the very proposition that traditional Libertarians object to), and, as Rizzo and Whitman observe, “main problem with [libertarian paternalism]…is that it defines freedom of choice…in terms of costs of exit, without any attention to who imposes the costs and how” [original emphasis] (2009: 698). It is not our purpose to argue in favour of a particular concept of paternalism, liberal or otherwise, but rather to consider when paternalistic interference or policies overriding individual autonomy might be justified/appropriate or even required, along with who does the intervening and how. Discussion of these aspects contributes to both providing the rationale for and evaluation of the outcomes of a paternalistic action. In line with Thaler and Sunstein, “the goal should be to avoid random, arbitrary, or harmful effects and to produce a situation that is likely to promote people’s welfare, suitably defined” (2003: 179), and our focus remains on how “people’s welfare” or the social good could be derived in social marketing. Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 14 Despite the inherent difficulties, and drawing on the work of the German philosopher Friedrich Hegel on the essence of the good and upon where its normative foundations should be placed, some further light might be cast on a more practical response to this very complex philosophical problem of what the social good is and who defines it. In the Philosophy of Right, Hegel highlights the otherwise obvious: the need to move from the abstract to the concrete by translating ideas into practice (Hegel, [1821] 2005), thus challenging the merely abstract views of morality or ethics (Hegel, [1807] 1976; as also argued by Brenkert [2008], who emphasises the need for illustrative discussions of ethical issues). In Hegel’s view, based upon the foundational conjecture of the conception of human beings as active within a social context, the notion of “good” requires a social, rather than merely an individual, formulation, especially as moral principles are historically, culturally and socially situated. To close the gap between Kantian ([1780] 2004) deontological ethics and Hegel’s social theory, Jürgen Habermas’ discourse ethics offers a solution by highlighting that in a modern pluralist social situation people’s values are grounded in competing conceptions of the good, making purely ethical understandings of one another very difficult indeed. Thus, it is through the communicative form of “discursive processes of opinion- and', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ethical understandings of one another very difficult indeed. Thus, it is through the communicative form of “discursive processes of opinion- and will-formation” that decisions can be made: “To the extent that the transmission of culture and processes of socialization become reflexive, there is a growing awareness of the logic of ethical and moral questions … practical orientations can in the final analysis be gained only from rational discourse, that is, from the reflexive forms of communicative action itself”. (Habermas, 1996: 98) In light of this, it is the idea of discursive elaboration instigated by and surrounding human rights and the correlative principles supporting the translation of the legal rights and Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 15 obligations into effective practices that create viable grounds on which to settle conflicts between values of different individuals and groups within one community. Human rights have a dual nature with both moral and legal bases (see also Habermas, 1998: 189–93), and because they are created through a democratic elaboration entailing their comprehensive realisation, or as Michael Ignatieff sees them, “the language through which individuals have created a defense of their autonomy against the oppression of religion, state, family, and group” (2001: 83), human rights provide a scope to bring the competing social ideologies in a dialogue. In that sense, human rights become helpful as even though they do not provide an ultimate answer to what the social good is, the underlying principles of human rights that guide their protection and realisation can provide some direction to social marketers engaging with the complex considerations of the social good in social marketing theory and practice. Human rights Modern human rights, as a legal concept, can be traced back to the late-eighteen-century French and American declarations of rights, even though their philosophical foundations are much older and can be found in different cultures and religious beliefs beyond the influences and practice of constitutional democracy (see, e.g., Robinson, 1998). Internationalisation of human rights as actual and potential legal claims came with the adoption of the UDHR by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948. The UDHR was the first international instrument to universally proclaim and recognise the idea of human rights, and even though it is not legally binding on the signatory states it has offered a road map by which to guarantee the rights of all and everywhere, driven by an aspiration for human rights to become a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations” (UDHR, 1948: Preamble). Following from its initial success, which has led the majority of states to continue to express their commitment to respecting justice and equality for all, human rights have become Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 16 codified in several international human rights treaties, covenants, customary international law provisions, various regional agreements, and numerous domestic human rights bills and constitutional provisions, thereby creating a legally binding system for the protection and promotion of human rights across nations. Today, human rights norms exist as both moral and legal claims (see, e.g., Donnelly, 2003 and 2007; Habermas, 1996), and thus some regional and national differences remain as to what constitutes human rights (their “essence”) and how they should be realised in practice. Within the discourse theory of human rights, the tensions between the individual and communitarian claims have been long-standing as well. Human rights, while striving to be universal (i.e. applicable to all), inalienable (no one can be deprived of them) and indivisible (all of the rights are interrelated and interdependent) (see, e.g., UN OHCHR, n.d.), by their very nature safeguard the rights of the individual. The foremost goal of human rights has traditionally been to help protect individuals against unwarranted intrusions by the state and its agents (Turner, 1993; De Schutter, 2010; Rehman, 2010). Thus, the aim is to ensure the individual good through protecting their human rights, and not necessarily via communal expression of the social good.

       " Document(page_content='protecting their human rights, and not necessarily via communal expression of the social good. One may rightly claim that ensuring good for the community would ultimately benefit individuals within that community, but this is not always the case, and in situations where there is a conflict between the rights and freedoms of the individual and that of the community, the former usually prevail. In response to the difficulty in bridging cultural divides between the different notions and traditions of human rights, and as a way of addressing the continuous disjuncture in conceptualising and interpreting human rights as legal and moral concepts, a number of principles have been developed to assist all those involved in developing and interpreting Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 17 these rights to facilitate their realisation. Human rights principles thus guide all programming that is required – or desired – to follow the normative framework set out in international human rights instruments. The analysis that follows has been guided by experience from other fields, especially in the realms of justice and development. An example of mainstreaming human rights and assessing compliance with human rights values and standards by public bodies include the Human Rights Insight Project (2008) conducted by the United Kingdom’s (UK) Department of Constitutional Affairs to provide an evidence base for human rights policy development and, in particular, “to establish whether human rights can be used as a tool to improve the public’s experiences of public services” (Ministry of Justice, 2008: ii). A human rights-based approach to the work of public authorities is expected, as such bodies have legal obligations to do so; however, as multiple studies highlight, it is often the lack of understanding of “how” these standards should be implemented in practice, and in particular by frontline staff, that hinders successful compliance with (domestic and international) legal obligations. Thus, the proposed recommendations following the Human Rights Insight Project rightly included the need for the UK’s Ministry of Justice to develop (for the public authorities and government departments) a tailor-made human rights-based approach to customer care, based on human rights values, and which would be viewed as central to service delivery (ibid.). Beyond the delivery of public services, the private sector has also been encouraged to adhere to human rights values and standards, even though these are the states that remain the primary duty bearers in relation to human rights, including an obligation to protect against violations by third parties, such as business enterprises (see, e.g., UN OHCHR, 2011). The UN Global Compact is the main UN initiative for engaging with the private sector and business, and acts as a platform on which to develop, implement and disclose responsible corporate policies and Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 18 practices (www.globalcompact.org). As reaffirmed in The Global Compact Strategy 2014– 2016, the UN Global Compact aims to “increase the impact of business contributions to UN goals and issues” (2014: 3) and, by the same token, to facilitate the UN post-2015 Millennium Development Goals (www.un.org/millenniumgoals/). This voluntary initiative for companies calls upon them to “respect all international recognized human rights standards” (UN Global Compact, 2015: 13), and assists them in developing human rights policies to ensure that these rights are respected through all business functions. Human rights standards and principles are thus viewed as essential in devising mechanisms and processes capable of supporting and implementing human rights, whether in the public sector (based on their legal obligations) or private sector (being bound by mainly ethical commitments). For the remainder of this paper, we focus on government action only as a more clear-cut case of legal obligations towards human rights. That said, and despite the universally applicable human rights principles, a human rights-based approach requires additional adjustments and adaptations to fit the particular purpose or area.

       " Document(page_content='or area. As it is not workable to simply transplant the various human rights principles or norms to the social marketing context directly, for the purpose of this research we have selected and adapted three groups of core human rights principles that, as indicated in the following analysis, are most relevant and useful in the context of social marketing; namely, transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion (adapted from the UN Statement of Common Understanding; UNDG, 2003). This group of principles is often referred to as “process principles” (UNDG, 2011), and they sit alongside the “content principles” (ibid.) of universality and inalienability, indivisibility and interdependence and interrelatedness. Our focus on the process principles, over the content principles, was informed by experience from other fields. Despite certain challenges in Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 19 accurately measuring the success of a human rights-based approach, as indicators of success are still being developed (UNFPA, 2010), there have been positive efforts to measure the level of achievement of the particular process principles; for example, the level of “meaningful participation” in a programme. Thus, as experience elsewhere indicates (e.g. Ministry of Justice, 2008), the process principles can be more consistently applied in a human rights-based approach, making them more practical. This can be contrasted with the content principles; these are more difficult to monitor and evaluate, and thus are much harder to assess, meaning that they cannot easily indicate how a programme has contributed to this domain (ibid.), notwithstanding the significance of the “content principles” for the conceptualisation of a programme based on a human rights-based approach. It must be noted from the outset that the process-oriented principles have interwoven relationships with one another, rather than being distinct and separate, and should thus be approached as such in their interpretation and application. In the context of a human rights- based application, all processes need to be transparent and those involved in the decision- making and implementation must be accountable. Further, these processes must be ensured to be non-discriminatory, as all people have an equal right to protection and respect on the grounds of their gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and so forth. Depending on the context and the issue at hand, some communities and groups might be more vulnerable to discrimination in certain situations, which requires looking beyond the immediate origins of problems into the structural causes and their manifestations (see, e.g., Boesen and Martin, 2007). Such groups may include, for example, children or people living in developing countries (Witkowski, 2007). To ensure wide participation and inclusion, especially for the most vulnerable and marginalised communities and groups, people must be offered access to information and be part of decisions that affect them, Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 20 In practical terms, making such an analysis involves applying these principles to particular cases; for example, breastfeeding social marketing campaigns analysed by Gurrieri et al. (2013) did not meet the standards set by the process principles as they promoted a particular ideology without acknowledging alternative motherhood discourses (thus lacking transparency and accountability), discriminated against mothers who make alternative choices about infant feeding (i.e., failing to ensure equality and non-discrimination), and did not provide mechanisms for participation and engagement in the promoted behaviour for mothers who, for personal or health reasons, do not want to or are unable to breastfeed (resulting in falling short of promoting participation and inclusion). The argument we put forward is that these principles identify the key human rights considerations to be taken into account when developing and applying social marketing strategies and interventions to ensure that social marketing meets its defining criterion, which entails that “the social marketer’s goals relate to the wellbeing of the community” (Donovan and Henley, 2010: 1).

In many respects, the exercise in drawing a line between individual rights and community interests might be easier to achieve in the context of social marketing interventions, which tend to be limited to one community or nation, than is often the case with human rights standards that strives to be globally applicable and, at the same time, locally relevant. However, even then, most of the dilemmas are germane in the modern pluralist and multicultural settings of a nation-state. The opposing ideological pulls from the libertarian and communitarian positions are thus equally relevant for both discourses, as they involve considerations of the socially formulated good and its impact on the individual. In practice, what could be perceived by Communitarians as of wider social benefit and thus justifying the curtailing of individual choices, from the libertarian standpoint would be Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 21 viewed as a means of oppression; for example, in the area of public health the introduction of measures pertaining to mandatory vaccination involves a complex examination of moral and ethical dilemmas, which requires an assessment of competing considerations of individual autonomy and community interests and consequential legal regulation of the issue at hand (see Holden and Cox, 2013b; El Amin et al., 2012). Bridging this divide – which is, after all, value driven – is not easy; nor has it been easy for human rights scholarship or practice, and equally should not be expected to be easy for social marketing. A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing There are many examples of states’ involvement in regulating issues that have wide-ranging health implications, including immunisation (Holden and Cox, 2013b), tobacco (Hoek et al., 2010) and alcohol consumption (Rothschild et al., 2006). One area that has attracted increasing worldwide attention in recent years is the impact of obesity on public health (WHO, 2015). Social marketing campaigns have been identified as one of the key macromarketing measures to control obesity (Witkowski, 2007). Government-funded social marketing campaigns that aim to tackle the obesity epidemic have been launched in the United States (Huhman et al., 2008; Thackeray et al., 2002), the UK (Croker et al., 2012) and other European countries (Henley et al., 2011) and Australia (Atlantis et al., 2008; Sanigorski et al., 2008). Using the example of government policies in relation to public health and corresponding social marketing interventions addressing the problem of obesity, we illustrate how the relationship between states’ obligations (as far as the right to health is concerned) and the application of a human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing might play out in practice. Our focus is on the three groups of cross-cutting process-oriented Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 22 principles – transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion – as the most relevant in guiding social marketing interventions, with the first group predominantly informing the determination of social problems and issues requiring government-led interventions, the second instructing the approaches taken in social marketing interventions and the last advising the selection of methods and tools used in devising social marketing interventions and their assessment. Transparency and accountability The very issue of states engaging in paternalistic interventions is perceived as essentially incompatible with (traditional) libertarianism, as deciding how and to what extent one can benefit oneself is a matter of personal choice. This is of particular relevance to public health. The dilemma in the area of (preventive) public health rests on whether to achieve the public health goals, while sacrificing liberal values; or rather, to preserve liberal values, but at the expense of public health gains that can be achieved through paternalistic action. Sunstein and Thaler argue in favour of private and public institutions attempting to influence people’s behaviour if, at the same time, they preserve individual choice: “a', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='in favour of private and public institutions attempting to influence people’s behaviour if, at the same time, they preserve individual choice: “a policy … counts as ‘paternalistic’ if it attempts to influence the choices of affected parties in a way that will make choosers better off” (2003: 1162). In order to avoid some of the pitfalls identified by Libertarians as intrinsic in a paternalistic action (e.g. abuse of power or elitism on the part of government or other authorities), ensuring transparency and accountability in the employed processes might be a solution to legitimising such interventions, as it provides mechanisms for determining who makes the decision and on what grounds, which, in turn, creates a scope for the decision to be challenged and, if necessary, rectified. Further, a valid justification for paternalistic action can be found in states’ (legal) obligations in relation to human rights, as we outline below. Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 23 The legal basis for the global community to take interest in and call for collective action in addressing the problem of obesity, often through the organs and structures of the UN, stems from the need to attain the right to health, as comprehensively defined in Article 12(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) 1966,ii which constitutes one of the nine core international human rights instruments.iii The provision itself refers to “the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health”, followed by a non- exhaustive list of examples of state parties’ obligations in that regard (Article 12(2)), which is considered to cover a range of socio-economic factors that are critical for creating necessary conditions for the progressive realisation of this right, including access to essential foods that are safe and nutritionally adequate. In 2000, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESC) – a body that monitors compliance with the ICESCR – adopted a General Comment on the Right to Health, stating that health is a “fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights” (CESC, 2000: para. 1). The right to health contains both freedoms (e.g. to control one’s health and body) and entitlements (e.g. for the necessary protection systems to be in place), and is not to be understood as a right to be healthy but rather “a right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable standard of health” (CESC, 2000: para. 9). Therefore, it is unsurprising that what people eat – i.e. food diets – and how these affect people’s general health have been subject to steadily increasing governmental scrutiny, including legal and policy regulation, and social marketing interventions (Carins and Rundle- Thiele, 2015). Following the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (2003), at the end of 2011 a report was sent to the UN Human Rights Council, which Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 24 set out five priority actions that are needed to tackle the growing worldwide problems of obesity and unhealthy diets, ranging from taxing unhealthy products to monitoring food production and regulating advertising of unhealthy foods (De Schutter, 2011). Oliver De Schutter, the then UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, warned that the increase in obesity and in the prevalence of unhealthy diets are today a greater threat to health than tobacco, urging that “[j]ust as the world came together to regulate the risks of tobacco, a bold framework convention on adequate diets must now be agreed” (Srfood.org, 2014: para. 1). What emerges, therefore, is not only that states have invested interest in creating and promoting conditions that positively affect the health of the population, but also that states’ responses in this regard are necessitated by their national and international obligations to progressively realise the right to health. Therefore, the right to health, as defined in international human rights instruments, provides a universally accepted and legitimate foundation for states’ actions in addressing the obesity problem. The role of social marketing is thus to support states’ obligations in relation', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='foundation for states’ actions in addressing the obesity problem. The role of social marketing is thus to support states’ obligations in relation to human rights commitments by engaging in practices that strive to be rights-based and facilitative of social justice. Adopting a human rights-based approach also offers practical benefits to social marketing by shifting the social good debate beyond the dichotomous arguments of philosophical libertarianism and communitarianism (Brenkert, 2008; Ehrenhalt, 1995; Kymlicka, 1988; Nozick, 1974). Thus, rather than pursuing the complex dilemma juxtaposing the needs of an individual against a societal formulation of the social good, a human rights-based approach provides a means to depoliticise social marketing goals by grounding them in a dialogue that transcends any political context in an attempt to create a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations” (UDHR, 1948: Preamble). Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 25 This is not to say that the decision-making as to which rights to label “human”, and how they are to be realised, is not a political act in itself, but, rather, that decisions about which issues to focus on within social marketing should be guided by the tenets that are considered to be universally supported (Spotswood et al., 2012). Such an approach offers a practical solution to the ethical challenge facing social marketing; that is, “[h]ow do we ensure that this exciting new technology is used for ‘good’ ends?” when “social marketing technologies [can] be applied by partisans promoting their own particular visions of social welfare, which can differ significantly from those held by the general society” (Andreasen 1994: 113). Reframing social marketing as a tool that supports states’ obligations in relation to human rights commitments offers social marketing transparency and accountability that is not a product of any particular ideology, organisation or the people standing behind social marketing interventions (Dann, 2010), but contributes to fulfilling states’ legal obligations and commitments, and ensures proper responsiveness to the interests and needs of the people. There are numerous examples of social marketing campaigns conducted in response to states’ obligations with respect to public health. For example, Agita São Paulo in Brazil was developed at the request of the Secretary for Health in São Paulo in response to data indicating high levels of physical inactivity among the population (Matsudo et al., 2006). Similarly, Change4Life was launched in the UK in 2009 as a government response to public health data identifying childhood obesity as a major health issue (Croker et al., 2012). In the United States, coordinated by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the introduction of the VERB campaign aimed to increase the physical activity levels of tweens (Huhman et al., 2008). In the application of a human rights-based approach, the focus must therefore remain on accountability, which entails identifying those who are responsible for human rights realisation and whose capacities to Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 26 meet these requirements might need to be strengthened. However, the very “process” through which the realisation of these rights takes place is also recognised to be as important as outcomes, and thus necessitates it being ethically acceptable to lead to the achievement and sustainability of desirable outcomes (UNICEF, 2003: 7–8). The identification of social problems lies with the relevant state agencies and public bodies that, when identifying these problems, must ensure that they adhere to human rights commitments and utilise processes that are transparent and open to scrutiny. Public authorities must act compatibly with human rights, which stems from states’ international, and often domestic, legal obligations in that respect. As far as international human rights are concerned, state parties’ obligations lie in three areas: to respect (which entails refraining from harmful practices), to protect (including against non-state actors’ actions, where these are harmful for realisation of the recognised rights) and to fulfil (necessitating taking positive action, including adopting', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='actions, where these are harmful for realisation of the recognised rights) and to fulfil (necessitating taking positive action, including adopting appropriate legislation, regulation or other relevant policy measures) (see e.g. UN OHCHR, n.d.). In this context, a wide range of duties are placed on states to take targeted and concrete steps that encompass national public health strategies and plans of action, including developing and commissioning social marketing interventions, to ensure that rights, including to health, are realised. A human rights-based approach thus implies accountability of those who are involved in developing and implementing programmes, as well as transparency of the processes employed in these programmes to facilitate the monitoring thereof to ensure the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights. Equality and non-discrimination Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 27 The role played by social marketing in supporting states’ obligations in relation to human rights commitments is essential, and has also been extensively utilised to these ends. However, if one considers the various government-led campaigns and interventions, including general media representations of the obesity problem, in particular in the Western world (Gurrieri et al., 2013), one conclusion would be that the responses focus predominantly on fighting obesity, as opposed to ensuring healthy solutions that would lead to the improvement of general health and would aim at social justice. Such approaches carry consequences for ensuring that the messages conveyed in social marketing campaigns do not inadvertently or otherwise stigmatise or reinforce social stereotyping of certain groups or communities (Gurrieri et al., 2013). Furthermore, little consideration has been given to the impact of social marketing on health equity (Kerr, 2011), yet numerous studies indicate that the impact has not always been positive (Langford and Panter-Brick, 2013). Such risks are at odds with the human rights principle of equality and non-discrimination, which entails that all people have an equal right to protection, respect and freedom from discrimination and discriminatory practices. Many health campaigns relating to obesity focus on weight loss as the key outcome, rather than promoting well-being and health as their ultimate objective. For example, the issue is identified by Gurrieri et al. (2013), who, using examples of weight management, physical activity and breastfeeding social marketing campaigns, show how dominant health messages can make women vulnerable to stigmatisation and social exclusion. Following their argument, the micro-orientation of social marketing, with its focus on medicalised discourses and moralising practices, steers the social marketing discipline away from the social good (understood here as social and distributive justice) towards “simplistic binary oppositions” (ibid.,139). This is not a new criticism, as the politics of body size has been a subject of Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 28 feminist critique for much longer, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s following Susie Orbach’s 1978 seminal work, Fat is a Feminist Issue (see also Wolf, 1991; Banyard, 2010; Redfern and Aune, 2010). However, more than ever before, the so-called “obesity crisis” or “obesity epidemic” that once was a medical condition has entered into the realm of social discourse, where the focus has been predominantly on blaming and shaming those who fall into the category of the “obese”; as with all forms of social control, this phenomenon is not gender-neutral. Moreover, as other research also points out (e.g., Holland et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2011; Dickins et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2007), there is often a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the relationship between health and obesity, which necessitates a paradigm shift in current mainstream approaches. Weight and health are closely interlinked; however, as medical research indicates, it is the extremes on the weight scale that cause significant health implications. This is often combined with another factor affecting those who are overweight – that is, situations where overfeeding is accompanied by undernourishment, which leads to many health problems (e.g.,', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='those who are overweight – that is, situations where overfeeding is accompanied by undernourishment, which leads to many health problems (e.g., Koh et al., 2012; Seneff et al., 2011; Gillis and Gillis, 2005). Therefore, as many rightly argue (see, e.g., Gurrieri et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2007 and 2010), stigmatisation and discrimination against obese people often lead to further health problems, which creates a very complex situation where in an attempt to realise one right (to health), some other standards (e.g., the cross-cutting principle of non-discrimination) are trampled upon. Thus, when addressing the principle of equality and non-discrimination, social marketers should identify the meaning, scope and application of social marketing interventions on the target groups, as well as their broader societal impact. This requires identifying which groups might be most vulnerable in the particular context, and assessing the wider impact of the proposed interventions and, therefore, what Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 29 measures must be taken to minimise actual or potential discrimination of these groups. In practical terms, safeguard mechanisms must be established to monitor compliance and to ensure that issues of discrimination, inequality and vulnerability are addressed throughout the programme development, implementation and evaluation stages. To assist in implementing the principle of equality and non-discrimination, ensuring effective participation and inclusion of the target groups and others affected is essential for the gathering of data and information required to design reflective processes and to achieve desirable and sustainable outcomes. Participation and inclusion The principle of participation and inclusion entails that people have the right to access information and participate in making, implementing and evaluating decisions that directly affect their lives and well-being. Individuals and target groups should have access not only to information, but also to opportunities that allow them to develop their capacity for participation and to influence the decision-making that affects their lives. Thus, depending on the context, the principle of participation and inclusion should apply to all stages of the development, implementation and evaluation of social marketing interventions. This approach requires an analysis that aims to maximise participation and inclusion of the target groups to increase their empowerment and represent their diversity, leading to increased ownership and sustainability of the proposed interventions. Effective participation and inclusion are thus essential in the process of collecting data to draw more evidence-based conclusions, and in assessing the broader impact of the strategy in question, which is also instrumental in ensuring that social marketing measures respond to and address the needs of the target group. These are important drivers, as even well-intentioned efforts might not contribute to solving the problem, or may inadvertently negatively impact upon the target Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 30 group or other stakeholders, as various examples of social marketing interventions indicate (Gurrieri et al., 2013). Existing evaluations of social marketing interventions that aim to increase physical activity are dominated by quantitative measures of effectiveness – such as number of steps per day (De Cocker et al., 2011) or meeting recommended physical activity levels (Matsudo et al., 2006) – that solely focus on individuals who participate in the interventions. However, to satisfy the principle of participation and inclusion, qualitative research should be conducted as part of the evaluation process to enable exploration of the experiences of participants and those who are unable or unwilling to participate, in order to better understand the broader impact of the campaigns. Systematic reviews of social marketing interventions also indicate that although audience research is one of the social marketing benchmarks (Andreasen, 2002), the actual interventions are often delivered with minimal or no input from their target audiences (Carins and Rundle-Thiele, 2015; Kubacki et al., 2015). Adhering to the principle of participation and inclusion also supports Gurrieri et', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='audiences (Carins and Rundle-Thiele, 2015; Kubacki et al., 2015). Adhering to the principle of participation and inclusion also supports Gurrieri et al.’s (2013) call for more equitable participation in the development, implementation and evaluation of social marketing interventions for those whose right to health is being facilitated through social marketing, and those who might become (further) marginalised if unrepresented, which consequentially widens the inequality gap. The area of health interventions in relation to obesity and the right to health demonstrates, in a rather explicit manner, the complexity of what might constitute the social good in social marketing. Although the issue is often perceived and presented in medicalised discourses as straightforward, it also exposes the opposing pulls of commercial and social marketing (Witkowski, 2007). On the one hand, the broad availability of unhealthy foods is further aided by the often aggressive commercial marketing campaigns purporting to increase the profitability of the food industry (see, e.g., BMSG, 2011; Story and French, 2004); on the Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 31 other, social marketing campaigns aim to warn and educate the general public about the dangers of obesity and consumption of unhealthy foods. Non-participating, alienated and excluded individuals are, therefore, exposed to mixed and contradictory messages, but are expected to respond in the “right” way to these expert-driven stimuli. The emphasis of the various social marketing campaigns is predominantly on personal responsibility and encouraging individual responses (Rundle-Thiele et al., 2013), which often underrates the importance of the lived experience of individuals, the surrounding environment (including commercial marketing messages) and barriers to participation, such as structural inequality (Langford and Panter-Brick, 2013) and the availability of reasonable choices. Other relevant ethical considerations relate to social marketing using hidden persuasion techniques, such as nudging (Spotswood et al., 2012), where an expert-driven choice architecture is used to manipulate individuals to make the “right” decisions. If we were to look into the subject matter from a human rights perspective, two further issues emerge: the first relates to prioritising one right over others (often to the extent of those other rights being infringed upon), and the second pertains to the states’ three spheres of obligations to respect, protect and fulfil (as alluded to briefly above). Therefore, as much as personal responsibility should be encouraged among individuals in relation to social problems, it does not release states from their international, and often domestic, obligations, as states cannot deflect responsibilities onto individuals in response to these obligations. States’ obligations in relation to human rights often require some form of regulation of the non-state actors’ conduct, including in the commercial realm, if it is harmful to people at large and interferes with the realisation of recognised (human) rights. There needs to be a balance between how much should be expected of individuals in relation to the social problems they face, and the extent to which the state’s intervention is required to regulate the Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 32 wider environment so as to present the individuals with reasonable choices. This might include, as in this context, limiting or even banning some of the harmful practices employed by the food industry if they are deemed to negatively affect the right to health. Therefore, realising the right to health requires an ongoing engagement of the individuals and groups affected by the measures in the process of development, implementation and evaluation of social marketing interventions. Theoretical and practical implications Since the initial conceptualisation of social marketing in 1971, the majority of social marketing definitions have emphasised the importance of the social good as one of the discipline’s fundamental features (Dann, 2010; Donovan, 2011; AASM, ESMA, ISMA, 2013; Kotler and Zaltman, 1971; Lefebvre, 2011). Although the notion of the social good in social marketing has been explicitly considered in only a handful of social marketing', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Lefebvre, 2011). Although the notion of the social good in social marketing has been explicitly considered in only a handful of social marketing studies, there has been growing interest in exploring the meaning of the social good in practice (Brenkert, 2008; Gordon and Gurrieri, 2014; Gurrieri et al., 2014; Spotswood et al., 2012). The premise behind this article was to address the identified gap in social marketing literature, namely the lack of effective and efficient theoretical engagement with the concept of the social good, which, nonetheless, is essential to realising the purpose of social marketing (Brenkert, 2008). This article, therefore, builds on and extends prior literature by identifying the key human rights principles in the context of social marketing – i.e. transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion – and by examining the applicability of a human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing. Along with the other two types of social interventions – that is, education and the law – that inform and instruct people to change behaviour or, indeed, to coercively regulate free-market Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 33 situations (Rothschild, 1999), social marketing’s role lies in influencing voluntary changes of behaviour by offering choices conducive to those changes and providing further reinforcement of the related decisions. Therefore, the choice of marketing tools, the target audience and the means by which these groups are targeted becomes critical for achieving socially responsible interventions. In practice, social marketing may rely on commercial partnerships and/or revenue-generating commercial activities to deliver long-term behaviour change (e.g., Mushi et al., 2003; Purdy, 2011). Yet, as long as in case of conflict between social and commercial aims the former take precedence, the focus on the social good entails application of the human rights-based approach. Focusing on the dominant anti-obesity discourse and social marketing interventions in relation to improving public health – even though these are not necessarily conclusive or archetypal of social marketing practice as such – created a platform on which to bring to light the rationale for why social marketers might need to improve their navigation of ideals and practices by focusing on human rights principles to strengthen social justice and, consequently, to fulfil social marketing’s foundational aim (see, e.g., Lazer and Kelly, 1973: 26). There is scope for social marketing to not only learn from the human rights discourse to further conceptualise the social good, but also establish a discrete and practice-informed approach to guide its normative development and implementation strategies. As we sought to elucidate through an illustrative case study of the anti-obesity discourse and some of the issues emerging in relation to the right to health, even though social marketers are not bound by law to observe and protect human rights, there are many reasons why they should consider a human rights-based approach to the social good in their day-to-day practice. Aside from ethical arguments in favour of adopting such an approach, there is also a Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 34 viable pragmatic rationalisation, including an increase in effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy of social marketing strategies and interventions. Employing a human rights-based approach helps improve risk management and identify opportunities, and offers a particularly useful method for dealing with complex and challenging issues, thus, arguably, constituting best practice. A human rights-based approach offers social marketers a practical guide that facilitates recognition of society’s expectations and helps to develop more sustainable ways of addressing social problems by taking into account the universal benchmarks and minimum standards as proclaimed through the core principles of human rights: transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion. This approach also supports states in delivering their obligations to protect, respect and fulfil human rights, which constitute both positive obligations (acting towards realising human rights) and', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='their obligations to protect, respect and fulfil human rights, which constitute both positive obligations (acting towards realising human rights) and negative obligations (refraining from harmful practices). For social marketers, then, the considerations are not so much about what social problems there are and which of these should be addressed by social marketing interventions (as these are largely guided by states’ obligations), but how to address these social problems as part of social marketing strategies. Thus, applying a human rights-based approach in social marketing may require social marketers to change what they do and how they address the identified social problems. However, this does not entail that social marketers be particularly familiar with (international or domestic) human rights laws or other aspects of states’ (legal) obligations; rather, it encourages them to consider following the human rights-based approach to the social good as a step towards fulfilling the aim of social marketing; that is, to enhance the social good through social marketing. In practical terms, in the case of the human rights principle of participation and inclusion, such an attempt would be to ensure that the vulnerable and marginalised groups in society are given an opportunity to voice their Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 35 experiences and concerns in regard to the issues being addressed by social marketing, as well as throughout the formative and evaluative stages of social marketing programming. Further, while the availability of healthy food options might be the key ethical priority for commercial marketing (Witkowski, 2007), the human rights principle of equality and non-discrimination shifts the focus in social marketing towards the issue of “access” to healthy food options, and the sufficient reach of the interventions as being constitutive of the social good (Langford and Panter-Brick, 2013). Finally, availability, collection and dissemination of data and information relevant to social marketing interventions, and employing procedures and processes that are transparent, demonstrates and further reinforces the existence of accountability (De Shutter, 2014: 554). Approaching the social good in the context of social marketing through a human rights perspective offers a new way to theorise one of the focal constructs of social marketing – that is, the social good – which has so far not been sufficiently conceptualised in the social marketing theory (Brenkert, 2008). The approach constitutes a starting point for realising the potential for social marketing to address some of its shortcomings, including its gaining “recognition as a legitimate toolset for tackling a huge range of societal problems” (Truss et al., 2010: 27), and, indeed, to facilitate its future as a distinct and coherent discipline that can defend its autonomous status. Beyond the theoretical contribution of this study to the literature on the social good in social marketing, practical implications of the human rights- based approach to the social good in social marketing should be considered. Identifying the social good requires social marketers and all those involved in developing and applying social marketing tools to engage with the identified social issue (e.g. obesity) at a deeper, reflective level (Gordon and Gurrieri, 2014), considering broader social implications of their actions and any potential negative consequences (Andreasen, 2002; Brenkert, 2002; Donovan Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 36 and Henley, 2010; Cherrier and Gurrieri, 2014; Grier and Bryant, 2005; Gurrieri et al., 2013; Holden and Cox, 2013b). The approach to the social good in social marketing integrating the cross-cutting principles of human rights, i.e. transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion, provides a systematic way to assess the consequences of social marketing programmes at the stages of initial identification of the social issue, social marketing programme design, implementation as well as monitoring and evaluation (see Figure 1).

       " Document(page_content='in social marketing We acknowledge the complex reality regarding practical application of the proposed approach and the extent to which engaging with the meaning of the social good can and does take place. Nonetheless, we recommend this approach as it is capable of guiding social Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 37 marketers in their work by offering signposts and steps to follow in the social marketing practice to a greater extent than some other approaches identified and proposed in the social marketing literature (e.g. the libertarian or communitarian approaches). Furthermore, human rights-based approaches have been developed and successfully applied in many other domains (e.g. justice or development); thus, this proposal offers a pragmatic and effective way of identifying what is otherwise a complex philosophical issue. The proposed human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing involves considerations of the above-discussed cross-cutting human rights principles at every stage of social marketing programming, and requires it to be an integral part of social marketing theory and practice. Future research The proposed approach to the social good in social marketing does not offer a quick fix to what is an essentially complex and multifaceted issue. Drawing on experience from other fields, developing indicators or benchmarks by which to measure and assess the level of application of the particular principles is a lengthy and complex process that requires ongoing work to ensure their effectiveness and to address any potential bias in their application or misuse (e.g. Rosga and Satterthwaie, 2009; Green, 2001; in relation to (human rights) indicators relating to the right to health see, e.g., Hunt, 2003). It is, therefore, beyond the scope of this paper to flesh out every aspect of the proposed approach to social marketing, as this requires further normative analyses and empirical research capable of informing both theory and practice in this area. However, despite these limitations, this approach offers a solution to the ideological divide between libertarian and communitarian approaches in social marketing (Ehrenhart, 1995), and the wider debate in normative ethics and political philosophy on the nature of freedom Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 38 and autonomy, and the relationship between the individual and the state. While recognising the shortfalls, the proposed human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing has scope to be instructive as – irrespective of the personal preferences of social marketers, or, more importantly, recognising the differences in theoretical approaches – following the human rights-based approach not only constitutes best practice (and thus offers concrete and practical benefits to social marketers), but also amounts to compliance with (legal and other) obligations, and thus supports states’ (human rights) commitments that transcend any political divides. Thus, future research should evaluate social marketing interventions to verify their impact, including unintended consequences, on the target audiences and wider society in light of the examined human rights principles. This would allow for the development of best practice to achieve desirable and sustainable outcomes and ensure that these can be achieved through a process that is reflective of human rights standards. Further work should focus on practical application of the human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing in different contexts, and throughout the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation stages of social marketing interventions. For example, research should explore the challenges of applying the human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing in situations where commercial partnerships and/or revenue-generating commercial activities may adversely impact the social good; thus, a compromise between social and commercial aims is required to achieve progress towards the social good. Finally, as political and structural forces, along with commercial marketing, shape the social environment and the social issues that social marketing attempts to change, more work needs to be done in future to explore the potential of the human', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c2a86f034822e3e71eec16847d3ddb0255de17d.txt'}),\n",

Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 39 Conclusions This paper aimed to address some of the challenges facing social marketing and propose a human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing. This research is guided by a premise that ethical challenges of social marketing differ from those of commercial marketing (Brenkert, 2002; Gordon, 2012), despite the fact that some techniques used in commercial marketing can be and are used in social marketing. We presented the opportunity for the field of human rights to inform and assist the development of social marketing, and introduced a human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing, based on a number of cross-cutting human rights principles: transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion. The main contribution of this research to social marketing lies in three areas: first, it advances the debate on the social good in social marketing beyond the binary divide between the libertarian and communitarian ideological claims (Brenkert, 2008) and offers a solution to legitimising state’s paternalistic action in line with its human rights obligations; consequently, it proposes a practical approach to the social good in social marketing based on particular human rights principles; and finally, it positions social marketers within the larger context of states’ obligations towards human rights and redefines the role of social marketing in addressing social issues. Reaching out to human rights, in terms of both scholarship and practice, is well placed as the objectives of human rights and social marketing are closely correlated: they both aim to deliver socially desirable ends and to improve people’s lives. However, as we argue in this paper, no particular (international or domestic) instrument of human rights as such provides the ultimate answer to what constitutes the social good but, rather, the fundamental principles that inform the respect, protection and fulfilment of these rights – in particular, transparency and accountability, equality and non-discrimination and participation and inclusion – can Szablewska, N and Kubacki, K (2017) “A human rights-based approach to the social good in social marketing”, Journal of Business Ethics 40 offer social marketers guidance in their endeavours. This important realisation allows for some of the divides regarding the notion of the social good in social marketing to be bridged and for the current debate about the purpose and future of social marketing as a scholarly field to move forward in both its theoretical and practical aspects.

Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph Convolutional Network for predicting protein functions by leveraging sequence features extracted from a protein language model and protein struc- tures. It outperforms current leading methods and sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the size of current sequence repositories. Augmenting the training set of experimental structures with homology models allows us to signiﬁcantly expand the number of predictable functions. DeepFRI has signiﬁcant de-noising capability, with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-speciﬁc annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new conﬁdent function predictions.

Even though many functional regions of proteins are disordered, the majority of domains fold into speciﬁc and ordered three- dimensional conformations2–6. In turn, the structural features of proteins determine a wide range of functions: from binding speciﬁcity and conferring mechanical stability, to catalysis of biochemical reactions, transport, and signal transduction. There are several widely used classiﬁcation schemes that organize these myriad protein functions including the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium7, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers8, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)9, and others. For example, GO classiﬁes proteins into hierarchically related func- tional classes organized into three different ontologies: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC), to describe different aspects of protein functions. The advent of efﬁcient low-cost sequencing technologies and advances in computational methods (e.g., gene prediction) have resulted in a massive growth in the number of sequences available in key protein sequence databases like the UniProt', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(e.g., gene prediction) have resulted in a massive growth in the number of sequences available in key protein sequence databases like the UniProt Knowledge- base (UniProtKB)10. UniProt currently contains over 100 million sequences, only about 0.5% of which are manually annotated (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot). Due to considerations of scale, design, and costs of experiments to verify a function, it is safe to posit that most proteins with unknown function (i.e., hypothetical proteins) are unlikely to be experimentally characterized. Understanding the functional roles and studying the mechanisms of newly discovered proteins is one of the most important bio- logical problems in the post-genomic era. In parallel to the growth of sequence data, advances in experimental and compu- tational techniques in structural biology has made the three- dimensional structures of many proteins available11–18. The Protein Data Bank (PDB)19, a repository of three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies, has experienced signiﬁcant recent growth, reaching almost 170,000 entries. Large databases of comparative models such as SWISS- MODEL also provide valuable resources for studying structure–function relationships13,20. To address the sequence-function gap many computational methods have been developed with the goal to automatically predict protein function. Further, related work is directed at predicting function in a site- or domain-speciﬁc manner21–24. Traditional machine learning classiﬁers, such as support vector machines, random forests, and logistic regression have been used extensively for protein function prediction. They have established that integrative prediction schemes outperform homology-based function transfer25,26 and that integration of multiple gene- and protein-network features typically outperform sequence-based features even though network features are often incomplete or unavailable. Systematic blind prediction challenges, such as the Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA127, CAFA228, and CAFA329) and MouseFunc30, are cri- tical in the development of these methods and have shown that integrative machine learning and statistical methods outperform traditional sequence alignment-based methods (e.g., BLAST)26. However, the top-performing CAFA methods typically rely strongly on manually-engineered features constructed from either text, sequence, biological networks, or protein structure31. In most cases, for newly sequenced proteins, or proteins of poorly studied organisms these features are difﬁcult to obtain because of limited information (e.g., no text features or biological network available). Here, we focus on methods that take sequence and sequence-based features (such as predicted structure) as inputs and do not focus on, or compare to, the many methods that rely on protein networks like GeneMANIA32, Mashup33, DeepNF34, and other integrative network prediction methods. As a result, we present a method applicable to hundreds of thousands of sequences of proteins from unknown organisms, lacking the required network data. In the last decade, deep learning has led to unprecedented improvements in performance of methods tackling a broad spectrum of problems, ranging from learning protein sequence embeddings for contact map prediction35 to predicting protein structure36,37 and function38. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN)39, the state-of-the-art in computer vision, have shown tremendous success in addressing problems in computa- tional biology. They have enabled task-speciﬁc feature extraction directly from protein sequence (or the corresponding 3D struc- ture), overcoming the limitations of standard feature-based machine learning (ML) methods. The majority of sequence- based protein function prediction methods use 1D CNNs, or variations thereof, that search for recurring spatial patterns within a given sequence and converts them hierarchically into complex features using multiple convolutional layers. Recent work has employed 3D CNNs to extract features from protein structural data40,41. Although these works demonstrate the utility of struc- tural features, storing and processing explicit 3D representations of protein structure at high resolution is not memory efﬁcient, since most of the 3D space is unoccupied by protein structure.

In contrast, geometric deep learning methods42,43, and more speci- ﬁcally graph convolutional networks (GCNs)44, overcome these limitations by generalizing convolutional operations on more efﬁcient graph-like molecular representations. GCNs have shown tremendous success in various problems ranging from learning features for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models45, to predicting biochemical activity of drugs46, to pre- dicting interfaces between pairs of proteins47. Here, we describe a method based on GCNs for functionally annotating proteins and detecting functional regions in proteins, termed Deep Functional Residue Identiﬁcation (DeepFRI), that outperforms current methods and scales to the size of current repositories of sequence information. Our model has a two-stage architecture that takes as input a protein structure and a sequence representation from a pre-trained, task-agnostic language model, represented as graphs derived from amino acid interactions in the 3D structure. The model outputs probabilities for each function (see Fig. 1) and identiﬁes residues important for function pre- diction by using the gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (grad-CAM)48 approach, that we adapted for post-training ana- lysis of GCNs. We provide several examples where we auto- matically and correctly identify functional sites for various functions where binding and catalytic sites are known. Results DeepFRI combines protein structure and pre-trained sequence embeddings in a GCN. In the past few years, it has been shown that features extracted from pre-trained, task-agnostic, language models can signiﬁcantly increase classiﬁcation performance in many natural language processing49 and biological problems35. Here, we use a similar approach for extracting features from sequences and learning protein representations. The ﬁrst stage of our method is a self-supervised language model with a recurrent neural network architecture with long short-term memory (LSTM-LM)50. The language model is pre-trained on a set of protein domain sequences from the protein families database (Pfam)51, and is used for extracting residue-level features from PDB sequences (see Fig. 1a). The second stage is a GCN that uses a deep architecture to propagate the residue-level features between residues that are proximal in the structure and construct ﬁnal protein-level feature representations (see Fig. 1b). ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:3168 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications We train the LSTM-LM on a corpus of around 10 million protein domain sequences from Pfam51. Our LSTM-LM is trained to predict an amino acid residue in the context of its position in a protein sequence (see the “Methods” section for details). During the training of the GCN the parameters of the LSTM-LM are ﬁxed; i.e., the LSTM-LM stage is only used as a sequence feature extractor. The residue-level features constructed for sequences, together with contact maps, are used as an input for the second stage of our method. Each layer of the graph convolution stage takes both an adjacency matrix and the residue- level features described above, and outputs the residue-level features in the next layer. We explore different types of graph convolutions, including the most widely used Kipf & Welling graph convolutional layer (GraphConv)44, Chebyshev spectral graph convolutions (ChebConv)52, SAmple and aggreaGatE convolutions (SAGEConv)53, Graph Attention (GAT)54, and a combination of different graph convolutional layers with different propagation rules (MultiGraphConv)55. Our comparison between different graph convolution formulations is shown in the “Methods” section and Supplementary Fig. 1. Three layers of MultiGraphConv or GAT often result in the best performance across many of our experiments. The GCN protein representation is obtained by concatenating features from all layers of this GCN into a single feature matrix and is subsequently fed into two fully connected layers to produce the ﬁnal protein function predictions for all terms (see “Methods” for details on GCN architecture). We train different models to predict GO terms (one model for each branch of the GO: molecular function, cellular component, biological process) and EC numbers. The GO terms are selected to have at least 50 and not more than 5000 training examples,', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='cellular component, biological process) and EC numbers. The GO terms are selected to have at least 50 and not more than 5000 training examples, whereas EC numbers are selected from levels 3 and 4 of the EC tree as they are the most speciﬁc descriptors of the enzymatic functions. We evaluate the function prediction performance by two measures commonly used in the CAFA challenges27 (see “Methods”): (1) protein-centric maximum F-score (Fmax) which measures the accuracy of assigning GO terms/EC numbers to a protein, and is computed as a harmonic mean of the precision and recall; and (2) term-centric area under precision-recall (AUPR) curve, which measures the accuracy of assigning proteins to different GO terms/EC numbers. When reporting the overall performance of a method the AUPR and Fmax scores are averaged over all GO terms and all proteins in the test set, respectively. To compare different methods we also report the precision-recall curves representing the average precision and recall at the different values of the decision threshold t ∈ [0, 1]. This architecture leads to the main advantage of our method, that it convolves features over residues that are distant in the primary sequence, but close to each other in the 3D space, without having to learn these functionally relevant proximities from the data. Such an operation, implemented here using graph convolution, leads to better protein feature representations and ultimately to more accurate function predictions as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. These results illustrate the importance of both graph convolutions and protein language model features as components of DeepFRI. Speciﬁcally, DeepFRI outperforms a baseline model which only takes into account contact maps in combination with simple one-hot sequence encoding, indicating that the LSTM-LM features signiﬁcantly boost the predictive power compared to simpliﬁed residue feature representation. Moreover, by comparing DeepFRI with a baseline model that takes only language model features into account, we show the importance of protein structures and the effect of the long-range connections in the predictive performance of DeepFRI. DeepFRI improves performance when protein models are included in the training. We investigate the performance of DeepFRI trained only on experimentally determined, high-quality structures from the PDB. Further, to explore the possibility of including a large number of available protein models into the training, we examine the performance when homology models from SWISS-MODEL are included in the training procedure. This signiﬁcantly increases the number of training samples per Fig. 1 Schematic method overview. a LSTM language model, pre-trained on ~10 million Pfam protein sequences, used for extracting residue-level features of PDB sequence. b Our GCN with three graph convolutional layers for learning complex structure–function relationships.

GO term and EC number annotations for PDB and SWISS-MODEL chains are retrieved from SIFTS56 and Uni- ProtKB/Swiss-Prot repositories, respectively. We report all our results on a test set consisting of only experimental PDB struc- tures with varying degrees of sequence identity to the training set. For each annotated chain in PDB and SWISS-MODEL, we extract its sequence and construct its Cα–Cα contact map (see “Methods” for data collection and pre-processing). We systematically explore the effect of different Cα–Cα distance thresholds and different types of contact maps on the predictive power of DeepFRI (see Supplementary Fig. 3). We further explore different structure prediction methods for both training and prediction of newly observed sequences and ﬁnd that using models from SWISS- MODEL during training greatly improves model comprehension and accuracy. First, we explore how DeepFRI trained on PDB structures tolerates modeling errors, by comparing its performance on models obtained from SWISS-MODEL13 and other de novo structure prediction protocols (see Figs. 2a, d). We extract the sequences from about 700 experimentally annotated PDB chains (we refer to this dataset as PDB700), carry out structure prediction using both the Rosetta macro-molecular modeling suite57 and the', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",

We construct two kinds of Cα–Cα contact maps for each PDB chain—one from its experimental (i.e., NATIVE) structure and one from the lowest-energy (i.e., LE) model. DeepFRI exhibits higher performance (with Fmax = 0.657/0.633/0.619 for native structures and models from DMPFold and Rosetta, respectively) than that of the CNN-based method DeepGO (Fmax = 0.525) even when accounting for errors in predicted contact maps (Fig. 2a). To further test the robustness in predicting GO terms with degrading quality of predicted models, we compute the Fmax score on a set of Rosetta models with different template modeling scores (TM-scores)58 and compare them to the results from the sequence-only CNN model (see Fig. 2b). Speciﬁcally, for each sequence in the PDB700 dataset, we obtain 1500 Rosetta models with different TM-scores computed against their corresponding native structure. Even for low TM- scores we obtain better performance in GO term classiﬁcation than the sequence-only CNN-based method (Fig. 2c). For example, Fig. 2c shows the output of DeepFRI with varying quality (TM-score) of Rosetta models of rat intestinal lipid- binding apoprotein (PDB id: 1IFC). For models with TM-scores >0.58, DeepFRI correctly predicts four GO terms including lipid Fig. 2 Performance of DeepFRI in predicting MF-GO terms of experimental structures and protein models. a Precision-recall curves showing the performance of DeepFRI on ~700 protein contact maps (PDB700 dataset) from NATIVE PDB structures (CMAP_NATIVE, black), their corresponding Rosetta-predicted lowest energy (LE) models (CMAP-Rosetta_LE, orange) and DMPfold lowest energy (LE) models (CMAP-DMPFold_LE, red), in comparison to the sequence-only CNN-based method (SEQUENCE, blue).

Here, we consider DeepFRI scores above 0.5 to be signiﬁcant. Even though Rosetta models often result in noisy contact maps, the performance of our method on the lowest energy models is not drastically impaired (Fig. 2a), which is due to the high denoising ability of the GCN implied by a high correlation between GCN features extracted from NATIVE and LE contact maps (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, the high tolerance for predicting functions from low-quality models is due to powerful language model features, which the model is mainly relying on when making those predictions.

       " Document(page_content='procedure. A large number of diverse structures in the training set is an important prerequisite for more accurate and robust performance of our deep learning-based method. To this end, we combine ~30 k non-redundant experimental structures from the PDB and ~220 k non-redundant homology models from the SWISS-MODEL repository. Inclusion of SWISS- MODEL models not only results in more training examples and consequently in more accurate performance (Fmax = 0.455/0.545 on structures from the PDB/PDB & SWISS-MODEL, see Fig. 2e), but it also results in a larger GO term coverage, especially in the number of very speciﬁc, rarely-occurring GO terms (information content, IC >10; Supplementary Fig. 5). Comparing the performance of our model with the CNN-based method, DeepGO38 that operates only on sequences, and the BLAST baseline, we observe that our method beneﬁts greatly from homology models (Fig. 2e). DeepFRI outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. To compare the performance of our method with previously pub- lished methods, we use a test set of PDB chains with experi- mentally conﬁrmed functional annotations, comprising of subsets of PDB chains with varying degrees of sequence identity to the training set. We compare our method to two sequence-based annotation transfer methods (i.e., BLAST27 and FunFams24), one state-of-the-art deep learning method (DeepGO38), and one feature engineering-based machine learning method (FFPred31). CAFA challenges commonly use the BLAST baseline, in which every test sequence receives GO terms that are transferred from the sequence in the training set with the score being the pairwise sequence identity. FunFams is one of the top-performing meth- ods in CAFA challenges in which test sequences are scanned against a library of HMMs of CATH superfamilies. A test sequence is ﬁrst mapped to a most likely FunFam (i.e., with the highest HMM score); then GO terms and EC numbers of that FunFam are transferred to the test sequence. The conﬁdence score for each predicted GO term is computed as the annotation frequency of that GO term among the seed sequences of the FunFam24. DeepGO is a state-of-the-art CNN-based method trained on the same number of protein sequences as DeepFRI. DeepGO uses 1D convolution layers with varying sizes of con- volutional ﬁlters to extract hierarchical features from the protein sequences (see “Methods” for the architecture details). The performance of our method in comparison to state-of-the- art and baseline methods is shown in Fig. 3. In terms of both protein-centric Fmax, our method outperforms other methods on MF- and BP-GO terms (Fig. 3a, e). Moreover, DeepFRI learns general structure–function relationships more robustly than other methods by predicting MF-GO terms of proteins with low sequence identity to the training set. To investigate this, we partitioned our test set into groups based on maximum sequence identity to the training set and computed the protein-centric Fmax score within each group (Fig. 3b). DeepFRI robustly predicts MF- GO terms of proteins with ≤30% sequence identity to the training set (with a median Fmax = 0.545 compared to a median of Fmax = 0.514 for FunFams and Fmax = 0.491 for DeepGO), and outper- forms both FunFams and DeepGO at other sequence identity cutoffs. Even though DeepFRI achieves somewhat higher precision in low recall region in predicting EC numbers at 30% sequence identity (see Fig. 3c), FunFams outperforms both DeepFRI and DeepGO with the higher Fmax score across different sequence identity thresholds (Fig. 3c, d); This is especially the case for PDB chains in our test set from underrepresented protein families. However, this not the case for PDB chains belonging to protein families well represented in our training set, on which DeepFRI outperforms or has a comparable performance to FunFams (see Supplementary Fig. 19). DeepFRI outperforms the sequence-only CNN (DeepGO) and the BLAST baseline for more speciﬁc MF-GO terms (IC > 5) with fewer training examples (see Fig. 3f). In addition to testing the robustness of DeepFRI in case when a certain level of homology relationships between the training and the test set is allowed (Fig. 3b, d), we also test its robustness when the test set is comprised of non-homologous PDB chains. That is, the PDB chains belonging to protein families (i.e., Pfam51 IDs) and structural/fold classes (i.e., CATH4 IDs) different than the ones in the training set.

       " Document(page_content='Pfam51 IDs) and structural/fold classes (i.e., CATH4 IDs) different than the ones in the training set. To do this we remove PDB chains belonging to 23 largest protein families covering 3224 PDB chains from our training set, train the model on the rest, and report the results on the held our (i.e., unseen) Pfams. See Supplementary Fig. 21 for the performance results and the list of Pfam IDs in the test set. Similarly, we perform another train/test split by composing a test set of PDB chains associated with the 4 most common (and largest in our set of) folds obtained from CATH database: TIM barrel, Immunoglobulin-like, Jelly Rolls and Alpha-Beta plaits, covering in total 4759 PDB chains. We trained the model on the rest of the PDB chains, covering other structural/fold classes, and report the performance results on the test set (see Supplementary Fig. 22). In the ﬁrst case, we observe higher performance of DeepFRI (Fmax = 0.6) than in the second case (Fmax < 0.3 across all 4 CATH folds), which can be explained by the fact that DeepFRI’s LM, pre-trained on the entire Pfam database, is helping the model generalize well on the unseen Pfams. Thus, the second case is a much more reliable setting for testing the robustness of DeepFRI. In the second case, a much lower performance of DeepFRI is observed, indicating the difﬁculty of DeepFRI to generalize well on the unseen fold classes. However, it can still generalize its performance on these folds better than sequence-based DeepGO and BLAST baseline indicated by the higher value of Fmax score (Supplementary Fig. 22). It is important to note that different methods encompass different subsets of the GO-term vocabulary and that a key advantage of using comparative models (for instance from SWISS- MODEL) in training is the increase in the size of the vocabulary encompassed by our method. Comparison to the standard feature engineering-based, SVM-based method FFPred, is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Given that FFPred is limited in the number of GO terms for which it makes predictions (131 MF-GO, 379 BP- GO, and 76 CC-GO on our test set), and also it cannot predict EC numbers, we only show the result averaged over a subset of GO terms common to all methods. Moreover, different methods have different coverages, i.e., the number of proteins in our test set for which they make predictions (see legend in Fig. 3a–d). For example, FunFams is not able to predict MF-GO terms/EC numbers for 28%/14% of proteins in our test set (the total coverage for the entire test set is shown in legends in Fig. 3b, d). We explored the performance of our method on individual GO terms. We observe that for the majority of MF-GO terms, NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:3168 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 5 DeepFRI outperforms the sequence-only CNN method, indicat- ing the importance of structural features in improving perfor- mance (see also Supplementary Fig. 7). DeepFRI outperforms the CNN on almost all GO terms with an average PDB chain length ≥400 (see Supplementary Fig. 7), illustrating the importance of encoding distant amino acid contacts via the structure graph. This demonstrates the superiority of graph convolutions over sequence convolutions in constructing more accurate protein features when key functional sites are composed of distal sequence elements (as is the case for more complex folds with higher contact order)59. Speciﬁcally, in the case of long protein sequences (e.g., >400 residues), a CNN with reasonable ﬁlter lengths, would most likely fail to convolve over residues at different ends of the long sequence, even after applying multiple consecutive CNN layers; whereas, graph convolutions applied on contact maps would, in 3 layers or less, access feature information from the complete structure. Class activation maps increase the resolution from protein- level to region-level predictions. Many proteins carry out their functions through spatially clustered sets of important residues (e.g., active sites on an enzyme, ligand-binding sites on a protein, or protein–protein interaction sites). This is particularly relevant in the Molecular Function branch of the GO hierarchy, or for EC numbers, and less so for terms encoded in the Biological Process branch.

       " Document(page_content='terms encoded in the Biological Process branch. Designing ML methods for identifying such functional residues have been the subject of many recent studies21,22,24,60. They exploit features from sequence or structure to train classi- ﬁers on existing functional sites in order to predict new ones. Even though DeepFRI was not designed or trained explicitly to predict residue-level annotations, we show how this is achieved by post-processing methods. To better interpret decisions made by neural networks, recent work in ML has provided several new approaches for localizing signal to regions of the input feature space that lead to a given positive prediction61–64. In computer vision these methods determine the regions of images that lead to positive object classiﬁcations48; in NLP these methods identify sub-regions of documents65. Recent work in computer vision uses gradient- weighted Class Activation Maps (grad-CAMs) on trained CNN- based architectures to localize the most important regions in images relevant for making correct classiﬁcation decisions48. We use grad-CAMs, adapted for post-training analysis of GCNs. For each protein, DeepFRI detects function-speciﬁc structural sites by identifying residues relevant for making accurate GO term prediction (for DeepFRI model trained on MF-GO terms), or EC prediction (for DeepFRI model trained on EC numbers). See an example of grad-CAM and its corresponding heatmap over the sequence in Fig. 4a, right. It does so by ﬁrst computing the contribution of each graph convolutional feature map of the model (trained on the MF-GO dataset) to the GO term prediction, and then by summing the feature maps with positive contributions to obtain a ﬁnal residue-level activation map (see “Methods”). For site-speciﬁc MF-GO terms (i.e., GO terms describing different types of ligand binding), we provide four examples where we automatically and correctly identify functional sites for several functions where binding sites are known (see Fig. 4).

Sample ROC curves for other functions including DNA binding (GO:0003677), GTP binding (GO:0005525), and glutathione transferase activity (GO:0004364) computed between the binary proﬁle representing binding sites from BioLiP and the grad-CAM proﬁle are depicted in Fig. 4b, and structural visualizations in Fig. 4c. Our study of grad-CAMs against BioLiP database reveals that the highest performing group of GO terms are related to functions with known site-speciﬁc mechanisms or site-speciﬁc underpinnings. We depict examples (with high AUROC scores) for which grad-CAMs correctly identify binding regions in Supplementary Figs. 8–15. For various GO terms, the functional sites correspond to known binding sites or conserved functional regions (see Supplementary Figs. 8–15). Interestingly, our model is not explicitly trained to predict functional sites, but instead such predictions stem solely from the grad-CAM analysis of the graph convolution parameters of the trained model; thus, the ability of the method to correctly map functional sites supports our argument that the method is general and capable of predicting functions in a manner that transcends sequence alignment. A similar approach can be used for predicting catalytic residues and active sites of proteins. Speciﬁcally, we apply grad-CAM approach on the DeepFRI model trained on EC numbers. To evaluate our predictions, we use a dataset composed of enzymes available in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA)67, a database that provides enzyme annotations specifying catalytic residues that have been experimentally validated and published in the primary literature. We use a manually curated dataset of 100 evolutiona- rily divergent enzymes from the CSA provided by Alterovitz et al.60 used for training their method ResBoost. Figure 5 shows results for a subset of PDB chains in this dataset, covering different EC numbers. Using the CSA as ground truth, we compute a ROC curve quantifying the accuracy of DeepFRI in predicting catalytic residues (see Supplementary Fig. 16). This result is not directly comparable to the performance results of ResBoost because we computed it only on a subset of 38 enzymes (out of 100 enzymes used for training ResBoost) for which EC numbers were in our training set. Moreover, DeepFRI is not designed to perform training on existing catalytic residues in the cross-validation manner (i.e., by hiding some catalytic residues in the training of the model, and then predicting on them) as ResBoost and it cannot control the trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity in predicting catalytic residues. DeepFRI is also not explicitly trained to predict catalytic residues using a set of enzymes with known catalytic residues and information about their positions in the structure. Surprisingly, a high AUROC score of 0.81 (Supplementary Fig. 16) stems solely from the grad-CAM analysis of our DeepFRI model trained on EC numbers.

Site-speciﬁc predictions provide ﬁrst insights into the correctness of predictions and frame follow-up validation experiments, for example, using genetics or mutagenesis to test site-speciﬁc predictions. Temporal holdout evaluation emphasizes DeepFRI’s perfor- mance in a realistic scenario. We also evaluate the performance of our method in a more realistic scenario using a temporal holdout strategy similar to the one in CAFA27–29. That is, we composed a test set of PDB chains by looking at the difference in GO annotations of the PDB chains in the SIFTS56 database between two releases separated by ~6 months—releases 18 June 2019 and 04 January 2020. We identiﬁed ~3000 PDB chains that did not have annotations in the 2019 SIFTS release and gained new annotations in the 2020 SIFTS release (see “Methods”). We evaluated the performance of DeepFRI on the newly annotated PDB chains from the 2020 SIFTS release. DeepFRI signiﬁcantly outperforms both BLAST and DeepGO (see Supplementary Fig. 17). Furthermore, we highlight examples of PDB chains with correctly predicted GO terms for which both BLAST and DeepGO are failing to produce any meaningful predictions, indicating again the importance of structural information (see Supplementary Fig. 17). DeepFRI makes reliable predictions on unannotated PDB and SWISS-MODEL chains. A large number of high-quality protein structures in both the PDB and SWISS-MODEL lack or have incomplete functional annotations in the databases we used for training and testing our models. For example, analysis of the SIFTS June 2019 release56 reveals that around 20,000 non- redundant, high-quality PDB chains currently lack GO term annotations. Similarly, around 13,000 SWISS-MODEL chains lack Swiss-Prot GO term annotations. Interestingly, even though the PDB chains lack GO term annotations, many have additional site-speciﬁc functional information present in their PDB ﬁles, for instance through ligands, co-factors, metals, DNA, and RNA. We use these cases to verify their function and discuss them in depth. A set of predictions, including many for truly unknown PDB chains, is provided in Supplementary File 1. For example, there are a number of PDB chains binding metal ions that have known binding residues in BioLip66, but missing GO term annotations (GO:0046872). In other cases, the function, albeit missing in SIFTS, is directly implied in the name of the protein (e.g., a zinc ﬁnger protein without zinc ion binding (GO:0008270) annota- tion). Here, we apply our method to these unannotated PDB chains, as a part of a blind experiment, to evaluate our predictions at the chain-level and the residue-level through the grad-CAM approach. We also make predictions on SWISS-MODEL chains. Supplementary Data Files 1 and 2 contain all DeepFRI high- conﬁdence predictions for the PDB and SWISS-MODEL chains. In Fig. 6a, b, we show their statistics, with the total number of PDB and SWISS-MODEL chains predicted with all and more Fig. 5 Identifying catalytic residues in enzymes using grad-CAM applied on the DeepFRI model trained on EC numbers.

Discussion Here we describe a deep learning method for predicting protein function from both sequences and contact map representations of 3D structures. Our method DeepFRI is trained on protein struc- tures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL and rapidly predicts both GO terms and EC numbers of proteins and improves over state-of-the-art sequence-based methods on the majority of function terms. Features learned from protein sequences by the LSTM-LM and from contact maps by the GCN lead to substantial improvements in protein function prediction, therefore enabling novel protein function discoveries. Although high-quality sequence alignment is often sufﬁcient to transfer folds or struc- tural information68, sequence alignments are challenging to use to transfer function (as evidenced by the poor performance of the CAFA-like BLAST benchmark) due to the need for different thresholds for different functions, partial alignments, and domain structures, protein moonlighting, and neofunctionalization27,29,69. Thus, one important advantage of DeepFRI is its ability to make function predictions beyond homology-based transfer by extract- ing local sequence and global structural features27. By comparing function prediction performance on DMPFold and Rosetta models and their corresponding experimentally determined structures, we demonstrate that DeepFRI has a high denoising power. Our method’s robustness to structure prediction errors indicates that it can reliably predict functions of proteins with computationally inferred structures. The ability to use pro- tein models opens the door for characterizing many proteins lacking experimentally determined structures. Further, databases with available protein models (e.g., homology models from SWISS-MODEL13 and ModBase20) can expand the training set and improve the predictive power of the model. The more extensive use of homology models will be the subject of a future study. While this paper mainly focuses on introducing efﬁcient and accurate function prediction models, it also provides a means of interpreting prediction results. We demonstrate on multiple dif- ferent GO terms that the DeepFRI grad-CAM identiﬁes Fig. 6 Predicting and mapping function to unannotated PDB & SWISS-MODEL chains.

For some PDB chains, the accuracy of the DeepFRI grad-CAM in identifying binding residues is quite remarkable, especially since the model is not designed to predict functional residues and the ligand-binding information was not given to the model a priori. However, the main disadvantage of considering this to be a site-speciﬁc function prediction method lies in the multiple meanings of grad-CAMs. Speciﬁcally, for some GO terms related to binding, grad-CAMs do not necessarily identify binding residues/regions; instead, they identify regions that are conserved among the sequences annotated', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='grad-CAMs do not necessarily identify binding residues/regions; instead, they identify regions that are conserved among the sequences annotated with the same function. This can be explained with the fact that any neural network, including ours, would always tend to learn the most trivial features that lead to the highest accuracy70,71. In conclusion, here we describe a method that connects two key problems in computational biology, protein structure pre- diction and protein function prediction. Our method linking deep learning with an increasing amount of available sequence and structural data has the potential to meet the annotation challenges posed by ever-increasing volumes of genomic sequence data, offering new insights for interpreting protein biodiversity across our expanding molecular view of the tree of life. Methods Construction of contact maps. We collect 3D atomic coordinates of proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)19. As the PDB contains extensive redundancy in terms of both sequence and structure, we remove identical and similar sequences from our set of annotated PDB chains. We create a non-redundant set by clustering all PDB chains (for which we were able to retrieve contact maps) by blastclust at 95% sequence identity (i.e., number of identical residues out of the total number of residues in the sequence alignment). Then, from each cluster we select a repre- sentative PDB chain that is annotated (i.e., has at least one GO term in at least one of the three ontologies) and which is of high quality (i.e., has a high-resolution structure). In addition to PDB structures, we also obtained homology models from the SWISS-MODEL repository13. We include only annotated SWISS-MODEL chains (i.e., having at least one GO term in at least one of the three GO ontologies) in our training procedure. We remove similar SWISS-MODEL sequences again at 95% sequence identity. Including SWISS-MODEL models leads to a 5-fold increase in the number of training samples (see Supplementary Table 1) and also in a larger coverage of more speciﬁc GO terms (see Supplementary Fig. 5). To construct contact maps, we consider two resides to be in contact if the distance between their corresponding Cα atoms is <10 Å. We refer to this type of contact maps as CA-CA. We have also considered two other criteria for contact map construction. Two residues are in contact if (1) the distance between any of their atoms is <6.5 Å (we refer to this type of contact maps as ANY-ANY) and (2) if the distance between their Rosetta neighbor atoms is less than sum of the neighbor radii of the amino acid pair (we refer to this type of contact maps as NBR- NBR). Rosetta neighbor atoms are deﬁned as Cβ atoms for all amino acids except glycine where Cα is used. An amino acid neighbor-radius describes a potential interaction sphere that would be covered by the amino acid side chain as it samples all possible conformations. Neighbor–neighbor contact maps are therefore more indicative of side-chain–side-chain interactions than Cα–Cα maps. To conserve the memory avoid training the model on protein chains with long sequences, we only construct contact maps for chains between 60 and 1000 residues. We have also experimented with different distance thresholds for CA-CA and ANY-ANY contact maps. We found that our method produced similar results when trained on these contact maps with a Cα–Cα distance of 10 Å, producing slightly better results (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Functional annotations of PDB & SWISS-MODEL chains. For training our models we use two sets of function labels: (1) Gene Ontology (GO)7 terms and (2) enzyme commission (EC) numbers72. GO terms are hierarchically organized into three different ontologies—molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). We train our models to predict GO terms separately for each ontology. The summary of GO identiﬁers as well as EC numbers for each PDB and SWISS-MODEL chain were retrieved from SIFTS56 (structure integration with function, taxonomy, and sequence) and UniProt Knowledgebase databases, respectively. SIFTS transfers annotations to PDB chains via residue-level mapping between UniProtKB and PDB entries.

       " Document(page_content='annotations that are (1) not electronically inferred (in ﬁgure captions/ legends, we refer to those as EXP), speciﬁcally, we consider GO terms with the following evidence codes: EXP (inferred from experiment), IDA (inferred from direct assay), IPI (inferred from physical interaction), IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype), IGI (inferred from genetic interaction), IEP (inferred from expression pattern), TAS (traceable author statement), and IC (inferred by curator), and (2) electronically inferred (in ﬁgure captions/legends, we refer to those as IEA— inferred from electronic annotation). Furthermore, we focus only on speciﬁc MF-, BP-, and CC-GO terms that have enough training examples from the non- redundant training set (see the section above). That is, we select only GO terms that annotate >50 non-redundant PDB/SWISS-MODEL chains. We retrieved enzyme classes for sequences and PDB structures from the levels 3 and 4 (most speciﬁc levels) of the EC tree. The number of GO terms and EC classes in each ontology is represented in Supplementary Table 1. In our analyses, we differentiate GO terms based on their speciﬁcity, expressed as Shannon information content (IC)73: ICðGOiÞ ¼ \\x02log2ProbðGOiÞ; ð1Þ where, Prob(GOi) is the probability of observing GO term i in the UniProt-GOA database (ni/n, where ni—number of proteins annotated with GO term i and n— total number of proteins in UniProt-GOA). Infrequent GO terms (i.e., more speciﬁc) have higher IC values. Training and test set construction. We partition the non-redundant set com- posed of PDB and SWISS-MODEL sequences into training, validation, and test sets, with approximate ratios 80/10/10%. The test set, comprising of only experi- mentally determined PDB structures and experimentally determined annotations is chosen to have PDB chains with varying degrees of sequence identity (i.e., 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, and 95% sequence identity) to the training set. Furthermore, each PDB chain in the test set is chosen to have at least one experimentally conﬁrmed GO term in each branch of GO. See Supplementary Table 2. We use the CD-HIT clustering tool74 to select SWISS-MODEL sequences that are dissimilar to the test set and to split them into training and validation sets. We examine the performance of our method when trained only on PDB, only on SWISS-MODEL and both PDB & SWISS-MODEL contact maps; we also investigate training on only EXP and both EXP & IEA function labels (see Supplementary Fig. 18A). In all our experiments we trained the model using both EXP and IEA GO annotations), but the test set, composed of only experimentally annotated PDB chains (EXP), is always kept ﬁxed. See Supplementary Table 1. The ﬁnal results are averaged over 100 bootstraps of the test set, in all our experiments. Preparation of a benchmark set of protein models. The initial set of benchmark structures used here was Jane and Dave Richardson’s Top 500 dataset75. It is a set of hand curated, high-resolution, and high quality (the top 500 best), protein structures that were chosen for their ﬁt to their completeness, how well they ﬁt the experimental data, and lack of high energy structural outliers (bond angle and bond length deviations76). This set has been used in the past for ﬁtting Rosetta energy/ score terms and numerous other structural-bioinformatics validation tasks. Unfortunately, the structures in this set lacked sufﬁcient annotations (many of these structures were the results of structural genomics efforts and had no, or only high level, annotations in GO and EC). Accordingly, we choose an additional 200 sequences from the PDB. These additional high-quality benchmark structures were chosen by taking 119K chains with functional annotations and ﬁltering them with the PISCES Protein Sequence Culling Server77 with the following criteria: sequence percentage identity: ≤25, resolution: 0.0–2.0, R-factor: 0.2, sequence length: 40–500, non-X-ray entries: Excluded, CA-only entries: Excluded, Cull PDB by chain. This left us with 1606 SIFTS annotated chains from which we randomly selected 200 chains. These PDB chains together with the Top500 PDB chains (we refer to this combined set as PDB700) were then excluded from all phases of model training. The performance of our method on this set of PDB chains is shown in Fig. 2a. In Supplementary Fig. 4, we demonstrate the denoising capabilities of our method on this set of structures.

       " Document(page_content='the denoising capabilities of our method on this set of structures. Comparison with existing methods CNNs. CNNs have shown tremendous success in extracting information from sequence data and making highly accurate predictive models. Their success can be attributed to convolutional layers with a highly reduced number of learnable parameters, which allow multi-level and hierarchical feature extraction. In the last few years, a large body of work has been published covering various applications of CNNs, such as the prediction of protein functions38 and subcellular localization78, prediction of effects of noncoding-variants79 and protein fold recognition80. Here we use the CNN-based DeepGO tool38 in our comparison study. We describe this architecture in more detail in the Supplementary Material. We represent a protein sequence with L amino acid residues as a feature matrix X = [x1, …, xL] ∈ {0, 1}L×c, where c = 26 dimensions (20 standard, 5 non-standard amino acids, and the gap symbol) are used as a one-hot indicator, xi ∈ {0, 1}c, of the amino acid residue at position i in the sequence. This representation is fed into a convolution layer, which applies a one-dimensional convolution operation with a speciﬁed number of kernels (weight matrices or ﬁlters), fn, of certain length, fl. The output is then transformed by the rectiﬁed linear activation function (ReLU), which sets values below 0 to 0, i.e., ReLU(x) = max(x, 0). This is followed by a ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:3168 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications global max-pooling layer and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation function for predicting probabilities of GO terms or EC enzyme classes. In the ﬁrst convolution layer, we use 16 CNN layers with fn = 512 ﬁlters of different lengths (see Supplementary Material). After concatenating the outputs of the CNN layers, we obtain an L × 8192 dimensional feature map for each sequence. Using ﬁlters of variable lengths ensures the extraction of complementary information from protein sequences. The second layer has ∣GO∣ number of units for GO terms (or ∣EC∣ for EC) classiﬁcation. BLAST. BLAST baseline is used in the same way as described in CAFA127: a sequence in our test set receives GO/EC annotations from all annotated sequences in our training set (comprised of SWISS-PROT sequences) with the prediction scores equal to the sequence identity scores (divided by 100) between the test and the training sequences. Prior to this, we remove all sequences from our training set that are similar to our test sequences using an E-value threshold of 1e−3, to prevent annotation transfer from homologous sequences, as previously described by Cozzetto et al.31. FFPred. FFPred is a support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁer on manually designed features derived from sequences such as transmembrane regions, sec- ondary structures, and sequence motifs31. FunFam. FunFam is a domain-based method that uses functional classiﬁcation of CATH superfamilies for annotation transfer. The method takes each sequence and scans it against CATH FunFams using HMMER381. Then it transfers all GO terms/ EC numbers from the FunFams with the highest HMM score to the test sequence. We followed the procedure described here https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/ cath-tools-genomescan to obtain GO terms and EC numbers for our test sequences. The GO term assignment score is computed as frequency of the GO terms among the seed sequences of the matched FunFam and propagated up the GO hierarchy as described in Das et al.24. LSTM language model for learning residue-level features. We use an approach similar to Bepler and Berger35 for training our language model. We train a LSTM language model on ~10 M sequences sampled from the entire set of sequences from Pfam51. The sequences are represented using 1-hot encoding (see above). The language model architecture is comprised of two stacked forward LSTM layers with 512 units each (see Fig. 1). The LSTM-LM model is trained for 5 epochs using an ADAM optimizer82 with a learning rate 0.001 and a batch size of 128. All hyper- parameters are determined through a grid search based on the model’s perfor- mance on the validation set. The residue-level features, extracted from the ﬁnal LSTM layer’s hidden states, HLM, are combined with 1-hot representation of sequences, X, through learnable non-linear', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",

We refer to this stage of our method as a feature extraction stage. The parameters, WLM, WX, and b are trained with the parameters of the GCN. All the parameters of the LSTM-LM are frozen during the training. We choose this strategy because it more efﬁcient (i.e., instead of ﬁne tuning the huge number of the LSTM-LM parameters together with GCN parameters, we only tune, WLM, WX, and b parameters while keeping the parameters of the LSTM-LM ﬁxed). Graph convolutional network. GCNs have proven to be powerful for extracting features from data that are naturally represented as one or more graphs42. Here we experiment with the notion that GCNs are a suitable method for extracting features from proteins by taking into account their graph-based structure of inter- connected residues, represented by contact maps. We propose our model based on the work of Kipf and Welling44. A protein graph can be represented by a contact map, A 2 RL ´ L, encoding connections between its L residues, and a residue-level feature matrix, X 2 RL ´ c. We explore different residue-level feature representations including one-hot encoding of residues as in the CNN (c = 26), LSTM language model (c = 512, i.e., the output of the LSTM layers), and no sequence features (to be able to run the GCN, in this case, the feature matrix is substituted with a diagonal identity matrix, i.e., X = IL). The graph convolution takes both the adjacency matrix A and the residue-level embeddings from the previous layer, HðlÞ 2 RL ´ cl and outputs the residue-level embeddings in the next layer, Hðlþ1Þ 2 RL ´ clþ1: Hlþ1 ¼ GCðA; HlÞ ð3Þ where, H(0) = Hinput, and cl and cl+1 are residue embedding dimensions for layers l and l + 1, respectively. Concretely, we use the formulation of Kipf and Welling44: Hlþ1 ¼ ReLUðeD \\x020:5eAeD \\x020:5HðlÞWðlÞÞ ð4Þ where eA ¼ A þ IL is the adjacency matrix with added self-connections represented by the identity matrix IL 2 RL ´ L, eD is the diagonal degree matrix with entries Dii ¼ ∑L j¼1 eAij, and WðlÞ 2 Rcl ´ clþ1 is a trainable weight matrix for layer l + 1. To normalize residue features after each convolutional layer the adjacency matrix is ﬁrst symmetrically normalized, hence the term eD \\x020:5eAeD \\x020:5. Equation (4) updates features of each residue by a weighted sum of features of the directly connected residues in the graph (adding self-connections ensures that the residue’s own features are also included in the sum). We also explore other types of graph convolutional layers previously proposed in the machine learning literature. Speciﬁcally, we tested the performance of DeepFRI on all of the branches of GO as well as EC classes with SAmple and aggreGatE convolutions (SAGEConv)53, Chebyshev spectral graph convolutions (ChebConv)52, Graph Attention (GAT)54, and a combination of different graph convolutions with different propagation rules (MultiGraphConv)55 in comparison to the plain Kipf & Welling graph Convolution (GraphConv)44. These convolutions differ in the way the features of the neighboring residues are aggregated. The performance of DeepFRI in predicting MF-GO and EC labels with these graph convolution layers is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Given that we are classifying individual protein graphs with different number of residues, we use several layers, Nl = 3, of graph convolutions. The ﬁnal protein representation is obtained by ﬁrst concatenating features from all layers into a single feature matrix, i.e., H ¼ ½Hð1Þ; ¼ ; HðNlÞ\\x03 2 RL ´ ∑L l¼1 cl and then by performing a global pooling layer after which we obtain a ﬁxed vector representation of a protein structure, hpool 2 R∑L l¼1 cl. The global pooling is obtained by a sum operator over L residues: hpool ¼ ∑ L i¼1 Hi: ð5Þ We then use a fully connected layer with a ReLU activation function for computing the hidden representation from the pooled representation. This is then followed by a fully connected layer which is used for mapping the hidden representation from the previous layer to a ∣GO∣x2 output; that is, two activations for each GO term. These activations are transformed by a softmax activation function, outputting the positive and negative probability for each GO', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c7a62a53486fdbbd27af9d80d15c51601709bab.txt'}),\n",

These activations are transformed by a softmax activation function, outputting the positive and negative probability for each GO term/EC number (i.e., the ﬁnal layer outputs probability vector ^y of dimension ∣GO∣ × 2 (∣EC∣ × 2 for EC numbers) for predicting positive and negative probabilities of GO terms (EC numbers). Model training and hyper-parameter tuning. To account for imbalanced labels, both the CNN and GCN are trained to minimize the weighted binary cross-entropy cost function that gives higher weights to the GO term with fewer training examples: LðΘÞ ¼ \\x02 1 N ∑ N i¼1 ∑ jGOj j¼1 ∑ 2 k¼1 wjyijklog ð^yijkÞ ð6Þ where Θ is the set of all parameters in all layers to be learned; wj ¼ N Nþ j is the class weight for function j, with Nþ j being the number of positive examples associated with function j; N is the total number of samples and ∣GO∣ is the total number of functions (i.e., GO terms); yijk is the true binary indicator for sample i and function j (i.e., yij1 = 1, if sample i is annotated with function j, and yij2 = 0, otherwise) and ^yij1 is the predicted probability that sample i is annotated with function j. In the inference phase, we say we predict GO terms/EC numbers if the positive prob- ability is >0.5. All hyper-parameters are determined through a grid search based on the model’s performance on the validation set. The validation set is comprised of ~10% randomly chosen samples from the training set. To avoid overﬁtting, we use an early stopping criterion with patience = 5 (i.e., we stop training if the validation loss does not improve in 5 epochs). We use the ADAM optimizer82 with a learning rate lr = 0.0001, β1 = 0.95, and β2 = 0.95 and a batch size of 64. The default number of epochs is 200. Both GCN and CNN are implemented to deal with variable length sequences, by performing sequence/contact map padding. The entire method is implemented using the Tensorﬂow/Keras deep learning library (see Supplementary Note). Temporal holdout validation. We also evaluate the performance of our method by using temporal holdout validation similar to CAFA27. The temporal holdout approach ensures a more “realistic” scenario where function predictions are eval- uated based on recent experimental annotations34. We used GO annotations retrieved from SIFTS56 from two time points, version 2019/06/18 (we refer to this as SIFTS-2019) and version 2020/01/04 (we refer to this as SIFTS-2020), to con- struct our temporal holdout test set. We form the test set from the PDB chains that did not have any annotations in SIFTS-2019 but gained annotations in SIFTS-2020. To increase the GO term coverage, we focus on the PDB chains with both EXP and IEA evidence codes. We obtain 4072 PDB chains (out of which 3115 have sequences <1200 residues). We use our model (trained on SIFTS-2019 GO annotations) to predict functions of these newly annotated PDB chains. We evaluate our predictions against the annotations from SIFTS-2020. The results for MF-, BP-, and CC-GO terms are shown in Supplementary Fig. 17. We also show a NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:3168 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23303-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11 few examples of the PDB chains with correctly predicted MF-GO terms by our method, for which both BLAST and DeepGO are not able to make any signiﬁcant predictions. Residue-level annotations. We use a method based on Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (grad-CAM)48 to localize function predictions on a protein structure (i.e., to ﬁnd residues with highest contribution to a speciﬁc function). Grad-CAM is a class-discriminative localization technique that provides visual explanations for predictions made by CNN-based models. Motivated by its success in image analysis, we use grad-CAM to identify residues in a protein structure that are important for the prediction of a particular function. In grad-CAM, we ﬁrst compute the contribution of each ﬁlter, k, in the last convolutional layer to the prediction of function label l by taking the derivative of the output of the model for function l, yl, with respect to feature map Fk 2 RL over the whole sequence of length L: wl k ¼ ∑ L i¼1 ∂yl ∂Fk;i ð7Þ where wl k represents the importance of feature map k for predicting function l, obtained by summing the contribution from each individual residue.

The advantage of grad-CAM is that it does not require re-training or changes in the architecture of the model which makes is computationally efﬁcient and directly applicable to our models. See Supplementary Figs. 8–15 representing grad-CAM mapped onto 3D structure of PDB chains with known ligand-binding information and Fig. 4 for grad-CAM mapped to 3D structure of PDB chains with known active sites. Residue-level evaluation: for each individual protein and its predicted MF-GO term/EC number, we measure the ability of our method in predicting binding or active sites. This measure can only be computed for the minority of proteins with detailed site-speciﬁc annotations; here we rely on the site-speciﬁc annotation available in the BioLiP database66 for ligand-binding proteins and the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA)67 for enzymes. For example, for a given protein of L residues, we construct a ligand-binding binary proﬁle (retrieved from BioLiP), s ∈ {0, 1}L, indicating residues known to bind a speciﬁc ligand (e.g., ATP); i.e., si = 1 if residue i is a ligand-binding residue, si = 0 otherwise. For the same protein and its corresponding predicted function (e.g., ATP binding (GO:0005524)), we compute a real-valued grad-CAM proﬁle from our pre-trained DeepFRI method, ^s 2 ½0; 1\\x03L, indicating the functional importance of each residue. To show how well the grad-CAM proﬁle recovers known binding sites, we compute the area under the ROC curve, representing the values of sensitivity for a given 1-speciﬁcity (false positive rate), using the sliding threshold approach; we then compute the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) using the trapezoid rule83. See Supplementary Figs. 8–15 for examples of ROC curves for different MF-GO terms and Supplementary Fig. 16 for ROC curve showing aggregate performance over different EC numbers. Reporting summary.

       " Document(page_content='AutoFCL: Automatically Tuning Fully Connected Layers for Handling Small Dataset S.H.Shabbeer Basha, Sravan Kumar Vinakota, Shiv Ram Dubey, Viswanath Pulabaigari, Snehasis Mukherjee Indian Institute of Information Technology Sri City, India. Abstract— Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have evolved as popular machine learning models for image classiﬁ- cation during the past few years, due to their ability to learn the problem-speciﬁc features directly from the input images. The success of deep learning models solicits architecture engineering rather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art CNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task, especially when training data size is less. To address this phenomena, transfer learning has been used as a popularly adopted technique. While transferring the learned knowledge from one task to another, ﬁne-tuning with the target- dependent Fully Connected (FC) layers generally produces better results over the target task. In this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the structure of FC layers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian optimization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize ﬁve pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NASNetMobile. The experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely CalTech-101, Oxford-102 Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning the newly learned (target-dependent) FC layers leads to state-of- the-art performance, according to the experiments carried out in this research. The proposed AutoFCL method outperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and Oxford-102 Flowers datasets by achieving the accuracy of 94.38% and 98.89%, respectively. However, our method achieves comparable per- formance on the UC Merced Land Use dataset with 96.83% accuracy. The source codes of this research are available at https://github.com/shabbeersh/AutoFCL. I. INTRODUCTION Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based fea- tures have outperformed the hand-designed features in most of the computer vision problems such as object recognition [1], [2], speech recognition [3], medical applications [4], and many more. Although several complicated research problems have been solved by deep learning models, generally, the per- formance of these models relies on hard-to-tune hyperparam- eters. Finding the best conﬁguration for the hyperparameters such as the number of layers, convolution ﬁlter dimensions, number of ﬁlters in a convolution layer, and many more to build a CNN architecture suitable for a given task, is the most demanding research theme in the area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) [5], [6]. Based on the previous studies reported in the literature, learning a suitable architecture for a given task is termed as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [7]. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been widely employed to ﬁnd the suitable CNN architecture for given task [8]. However, these methods are focused to ﬁnd the structure of CNN from scratch which requires hundreds of GPU hours. We propose a method called AutoFCL to automatically tune the structure of the Fully Connected (FC) layers with respect Fig. 1. While transferring the knowledge learned from source task to the target task, learning the optimal structure of FC layers with the knowledge of target dataset and ﬁne-tuning the learned FC layers leads to better performance. to the target dataset while transferring the knowledge from source task to the target task. Typically, every CNN contains one or more FC layers based on the depth of the architecture [9]. For instance, the popular CNN models proposed to train over large-scale ImageNet dataset [10] have the following number of FC layers. • AlexNet [1], ZFNet [11], and VGG-16 [12] have 3 dense (FC) layers. Note that these models contain 5, 5, and 13 convolution layers, respectively. • GoogLeNet [2], ResNet [13], DenseNet [14], NASNet [5], and other modern deep neural networks have a single FC layer which is responsible for generating the class scores. The CNN models [1], [11], [12] introduced in the initial years (during the years from 2012 to 2014) have a huge number of trainable parameters in FC layers. Whereas the recent models [13], [14], [5] are generally deeper, and hence, have a single FC layer which is responsible for generating the class scores.

[15] shown that removing the connections among FC layers having less weight magnitude (SparseConnect) leads to better performance. Basha et al. [9] performed a study to observe the necessity of FC layers given the depth and width of both datasets and CNN architectures. To ﬁnd the best set of hyperparameters of an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Mendoza et al. [16] proposed an automated mechanism to tune the ANN using Sequential Model-based Algorithm Conﬁguration (SMAC). CNNs are used in a wide range of applications in recent years. However, their performance is poor if the amount of training data is very limited. Transfer Learning is a way to reduce the need for more training data and huge computa- tional resources by reusing the knowledge learned from the source task. A common approach for classifying such limited images is re-using the pre-trained models to ﬁne-tune over other datasets [19]. However, while transferring the learned knowledge from one task to another, ﬁne-tuning the original FC layers’ structure may not perform well over the target dataset because the FC layers are designed for the source task. Fig. 1 illustrates the motivation behind learning the target- dependent fully connected layer’s structure to obtain better performance over the target task. While transferring the learned knowledge from source task to target task, the efﬁcacy (capacity) of the CNN increases for the target task, which may result in overﬁtting. The extracted features from convolutional layers (shown in the left side) are mapped into more linearly separable feature space (shown on the right side) by FC layers. Moreover, we believe that learning the FC layers’ structure with the knowledge from the target dataset may lead to better linearly separable feature space which results in better performance over the target dataset. In this work, we propose a novel framework for automatically learning the target-dependent fully connected layers structure in the context of transfer learning. We use Bayesian opti- mization [20] for optimizing the hyperparameters involved in forming the FC layers while transferring the knowledge from one task to another. II. RELATED WORKS Due to the dense connectivity among the FC layers, the deep CNNs contain an enormous amount of trainable parameters. For example, the ﬁrst ImageNet Large Scale Vi- sual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC)-2012 [21] winning CNN model called AlexNet [1] contains a total of 60 million trainable parameters, among which 58 million parameters belong to the FC layers. Likewise, VGG-16 [12], a 16 layer deep CNN comprises 138 million trainable parameters, among which 123 million parameters correspond to FC lay- ers. In practice, the over-parameterization leads to overﬁtting the CNN. Xu et al. [15] proposed SparseConnect model to reduce the overﬁtting effect by removing the connections with smaller weight values. Transfer learning is a widely adopted technique to obtain a reasonable performance with limited data and less computa- tional resources. Li et al. [22] analyzed various approaches for transferring the knowledge learned in different scenar- ios. Fine-tuning the deep CNNs with limited training data often leads to overﬁtting the CNN model [23]. Han et al. [24] introduced a two-phase strategy by combining transfer learning with web data augmentation to reduce the amount of over-ﬁtting. They also tuned the hyperparameters such as learning rate, type of optimizer (Adagrad [25], Adam [26], etc.) and many more using Bayesian Optimization. Mendoza et al.

       " Document(page_content='Mendoza et al. [16] proposed Auto-Net, which automat- ically tunes an artiﬁcial neural network without any human intervention. To learn a distinct set of hyperparameters auto- matically, they used the Sequential Model-based Algorithm Conﬁguration (SMAC). The hyperparameters such as the number of FC layers, number of neurons in each FC layer, batch size, learning rate, and so on are tuned automatically. Motivated by this work, we propose a framework to automat- ically learn the structure of FC layers concerning the target dataset for better transfer learning. Many researchers have employed Bayesian Optimization [20] to learn the entire CNN architecture automatically. Wistuba et al. [27] combined Bayesian Optimization with Incremental Evaluation to ﬁnd the optimal neural network architecture. However, they limited the depth of the CNN to 5 layers due to the limited computational resources. Jin et al. [28] proposed a network morphism mechanism for neural architecture search using Bayesian Optimization. Liu et al. [6] proposed a method to build the CNN architecture pro- gressively using the Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO) based algorithm. However, these methods require a considerable amount of computational resources and search time. Recently, Gupta et al. [29] employed Bayesian Opti- mization to conduct a study for efﬁcient transfer optimiza- tion. Transfer Learning allows the pre-trained networks to adopt for the new tasks [30]. Many researchers utilized the ad- vantage of transfer learning for various applications [19], [31]. Ji et al. [28] proposed a framework called Double Reweighting Multi-source Transfer Learning (DRMTL) to utilize the decision knowledge from multiple sources to perform well over the target domain. Generally, after adap- tation, the efﬁcacy (capacity) of the CNN increases for the target task. Molchanov et al. [32] proposed a framework for iteratively pruning the parameters of a CNN to reduce its capacity for the target task. With regard to our knowledge, no effort has been made in the literature to learn the structure of FC layers automatically for better transfer learning. Neural Architecture Search algorithms consume thousands of GPU hours [5] to ﬁnd better performing architectures. So, we made this attempt in the context of transfer learning to reduce the architecture search time. Basha et al. [9] analyzed the necessity of FC layers based on the depth of a CNN. However, to conduct this study they performed experiments by adding new FC layers manually before the output FC layer. Moreover, the hyperparameters involved in FC layers like the number of neurons in every FC layer, the dropout factor, type of activation, and so on TABLE I THE STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS PROPOSED FOR THE IMAGENET DATASET, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRAINABLE PARAMETERS AND THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS BELONG TO FC LAYERS ARE SHOWN.

In this paper, we attempt to learn the target-dependent FC layers’ structure automatically for better transfer learning. In brief, our contributions in this work are as follows, • We propose a novel method to automatically learn the target-dependent FC layers structure using Bayesian Optimization. • By conducting experiments on three benchmark datasets, we discover the suitable (target-dependent) FC layers structure speciﬁc to the datasets. • The performance of the proposed method is also com- pared with state-of-the-art transfer learning and non- transfer learning-based methods. • To compare the results obtained using Bayesian Opti- mization, we employed the random search to ﬁnd the best set of hyperparameters involved in FC layers. III. PROPOSED AUTOFCL MODEL We formulate the task of learning the structure of fully connected layers as a black-box optimization problem. Let f is an objective function whose objective is to ﬁnd x∗, which is represented as x∗ = argmax x∈H f(x) (1) where x ∈ Rd is the input, usually d ≤ 20 [20], H is the hyperparameter space as depicted in Table II, and f is a continuous function.

       " Document(page_content='space as depicted in Table II, and f is a continuous function. Finding the value of function f at x requires training (ﬁne-tuning) the learned FC layers (explored during the architecture search) of a pre-trained CNN (B) on training data (TrainData) and evaluating its performance on the held-out (validation) data ValData. The x∗ is a CNN with an optimal FC layer’s struc- ture learned using the Bayesian Optimization for efﬁcient transfer learning. Therefore, the CNN architecture x∗ is responsible for maximizing the performance on the ValData. The proposed AutoFCL method is outlined in Algorithm 1. Given the base CNN model (B), hyperparameters search space (Param space), TrainData, ValData, and the number of epochs (E) to train each proxy CNN as an input, the proposed method learns the most suitable structure of FC (dense) layers using Bayesian Optimization [20]. The Bayesian Optimization (Bayes Opt) is the most pop- ular method used for ﬁnding the best set of hyperparameters involved in deep neural networks [33]. Bayes Opt builds a surrogate model to approximate the objective function using Gaussian Process (GP) regression [34]. Algorithm 1 observes the value of f without noise for initial n0 points which are chosen uniformly random (n0 is 20 in our experimental settings). After observing the objective at initial n0 points, we can infer the objective value at a new point xnew using Bayes rule [35] as follows, f(xnew)|f(x1:n0) ∼ Normal(µn0(xnew), σ2 n0(xnew)) (2) The µn0(xnew) and σ2 n0(xnew) are computed as follows, µn0(xnew) = X 0 (xnew : x1:n0) X 0 (x1:n0, x1:n0)−1(f(x1:n0)−µ0(x1:n0)) + µ0(xnew) (3) σ2 n0(xnew) = X 0 (xnew, xnew) − X 0 (xnew, x1:n0) X 0 (x1:n0, x1:n0)−1 X 0 (x1:n0, xnew) (4) The probability distribution given in Eq. 2 is called poste- rior probability distribution. In the above equations, µ0 , P 0 are mean function and covariance functions, respectively. The optimal conﬁguration of FC layers is one among the previously evaluated points (initial n0 points) with the maximum f value (f(x+)). Now, if we want to evaluate the value of objective ’f’ at a new point xnew, which is observed as f(xnew). After evaluating the value of f at iteration n0 + 1, the optimal f value will be either f(xnew) (if f(xnew) ≥ f(x+)) or f(x+) (if f(x+) ≥ f(xnew)). The improvement or gain in the objective f is f(xnew) − f(x+) if its value is positive, or 0 otherwise. However, the f(xnew) value is unknown until observing its value at xnew which is typically expensive. Instead of Algorithm 1 AutoFCL: A Bayesian Search method for automatically learning the structure of FC layers Inputs: B (Base Model), Param space, TrainData, ValData, E (num epochs). Output: A CNN with target-dependent FC layers structure. 1: procedure AUTOFCL 2: Place a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the objective f 3: while t ∈ 1, 2, ...n0 do ▷ Observe the value of f at initial n0 points 4: Mt ← build CNN(B, Param space) ▷ sample the initial CNN randomly 5: Tt ← Train CNN(Mt, TrainData, E) 6: Vt ← V alidate CNN(Tt, V alidData) n = n0 7: while t ∈ n + 1, .., N do 8: Update the posterior distribution on f using the prior ▷ Using Eq. 2 9: Choose the next sample xt that maximizes the acquisition function value 10: Observe yt = f(xt) 11: return xt ▷ return a point with best FC layer structure evaluating f at xnew, we can compute the Expected Improve- ment (EI) and choose the xnew that maximizes the value of EI. Expected Improvement [36] is the most commonly used acquisition function for guiding the search process by proposing the next point to sample. For a speciﬁed input xnew, EI can be represented as, EI(x) = E[max(f(xnew) − f(x+), 0)] (5) where f(x+) is the maximum validation accuracy obtained so far and x+ is the FC layer’s structure for which best vali- dation accuracy is obtained. Formally, x+ can be represented as, x+ = argmax xi∈x1:n0 f(xi) (6) which utilizes the information about the models that were already explored and ﬁnds the next point that maximizes the expected improvement. After observing the objective at each point, we update the posterior distribution using the Eq. 2. IV. HYPERPARAMETER SEARCH SPACE This section provides a detailed discussion about the search space used for ﬁnding the target-dependent FC layer’s structure for efﬁcient transfer learning.

       " Document(page_content='various hyperparameters. To mention a few, the number of neurons, dropout rate, and many more. The proposed AutoFCL aims to learn the suitable structure for the FC layers, which includes the number of FC layers, dropout rate, type of activation, and the number of neurons in each FC layer to obtain the better performance over the target dataset. Table II shows the hyperparameter search space considered in our experimental settings. As most of the CNN architectures available in the liter- ature have a maximum of 3 FC layers [1], [12] including the output layer. Therefore, we consider the search space for the number of FC layers in the range [1,3] (i.e., 1, 2, and 3). The other important hyperparameter is the number of neurons required in each FC layer, for which the proposed method ﬁnds the best set of conﬁguration within the range [64, 1024] in powers of 2 ({64, 128, 256, 512, 1024}). Besides these hyperparameters, we consider activation func- tion as another hyperparameter. Three popular non-linear activations Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLu are utilized for the same. To reduce the over-ﬁtting caused due to a large number of trainable parameters in FC layers, dropout [1] is widely adopted in deep learning. We consider dropout as another hyperparameter to learn, the value of which is learned in the range [0, 0.5] with an offset 0.1 i.e., the proposed AutoFCL ﬁnds the suitable dropout factor within the values {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. V. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS In this section, we brief the training details, CNN archi- tectures utilized to learn the structure of FC layers and the datasets used to evaluate the performance of the developed image classiﬁcation models in the context of transfer learn- ing. A. Training Details Training Proxy CNNs: The CNN architectures generated in the search process of Bayesian Optimization (also called proxy CNNs) are trained using AdaGrad optimizer [25]. The initial value of the learning rate is set to 0.01 and its value is reduced by a factor of √ 0.1 for every 5 epochs if there is no reduction in the validation loss. Since training the CNNs is a time-consuming task, we train each proxy CNN for 20 epochs as in [6]. Batch Normalization [37] is used after employing dropout. The suitable dropout rate is learned using Bayesian Optimization. The parameters (weights) corresponding to the FC layers are initialized using He normal initialization [38]. B. CNN Architectures used for Fine-Tuning To learn the target-dependent FC layers structure auto- matically, we use two kinds of CNN architectures which include i) chain structured (plain) CNNs like VGG-16 [12] and ii) CNNs involving skip connections like ResNet [13], DenseNet [14], and many more. TABLE II HYPERPARAMETER SEARCH SPACE CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH NETWORK HYPERPARAMETERS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS AND PER-LAYER HYPERPARAMETERS LIKE ACTIVATION FUNCTION, DROPOUT FACTOR, AND THE NUMBER OF NEURONS ARE PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE. Name Values Type Network hyperparameters number of FC layers {1,2,3} integer Hyperparameters per single FC layer activation function {ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid} categorical dropout rate {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} ﬂoat number of neurons {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} integer We conduct the experiments using the popular CNN models that are trained over ImageNet dataset such as VGG- 16 [12], ResNet [13], DenseNet [14], MobileNet [18], and NASNet-Mobile [5]. In this article, we are interested in ﬁnding the optimal structure of fully connected layers for efﬁcient transfer learning. To achieve this objective, the parameters (weights) involved in convolution layers of the above CNNs trained over ImageNet dataset [10] are frozen. In other words, the convolution layers of the above CNNs use the pre-trained weights of ImageNet dataset. The parameters involved in newly added FC layers are learned using the back-propagation algorithm [39]. The structure of the FC layers is tuned automatically using Algorithm 1. 1) Chain Structured CNNs (Plain CNNs): In the initial years of deep learning, the CNN architectures proposed such as LeNet [55], AlexNet [1], ZFNet [11], and VGG-16 [12] have the varying number of trainable layers (convolution, Batch Normalization, and fully connected layers) and in- volves a different set of hyper-parameters. However, the connectivity among the different layers in these architectures remains the same such that layer Li+1 receives the input feature map from layer Li. Similarly', metadata={'source': './data_input/documents_sampling/0c9aeb9c58eefa0eb0e1a192a2e8dc8a78426fce.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='among the different layers in these architectures remains the same such that layer Li+1 receives the input feature map from layer Li. Similarly layer Li+2 receives the input from layer Li+1 and so on. We consider VGG-16, a 16 layer chain structured deep CNN to learn the structure of FC layers for efﬁcient transfer learning. 2) CNNs involving Skip Connections: Szegedy et al. [2] introduced a deep CNN named GoogLeNet with a careful handcrafted design which allows increasing the depth of the model. GoogLeNet has a basic building block called Inception block that uses multi-scale ﬁlters. Later on, the concept of skip connections became very popular after the emergence of ResNet in 2016 [13]. The skip connections are also used by recent models such as DenseNet [14], etc. Moreover, it also became popular among the CNNs learned using NAS methods such as NASNet [5], PNAS [6], etc. A layer in the CNNs involving skip connections receives multiple input feature maps from its previous layers. For example, layer Li+1 receives the input from both layers Li and Li−1 as in ResNet [13]; layer Ln receives the input feature map from all of its previous layers {L1, L2, ... Ln−1} as in DenseNet [14]. We utilized ResNet-50, MobileNet, DenseNet-121, and NASNet-Mobile CNNs involving skip connections to learn the structure of FC layers. C. Datasets To validate the performance of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on three different kinds of bench- mark datasets such as CalTech-101, Oxford-102 Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use. 1) CalTech-101 Dataset: CalTech-101 [40] dataset con- sists of images belong to 101 object categories. Each class has the number of images between 40 and 800. The most common image categories such as human faces tend to have more images compared to others. The total number of images are 9144 and each image has a varying spatial dimension. To conduct the experiments, we utilize 80% of the data for training (i.e., 7315 images) and the remaining 20% images to validate the performance of the deep neural networks. To ﬁt these images as input to the CNN models, we re-size the image dimension to 224 × 224 × 3. A few samples from CalTech-101 dataset are presented in Fig. 2(a). 2) Oxford-102 Flowers Dataset: Oxford-102 [41] dataset comprises images belong to 102 ﬂower categories that are commonly visible in the United Kingdom. This dataset contains 8189 images such that each class has a varying number of ﬂower images ranging from 40 to 258. We utilize 80% of the dataset (6551 images) for training the CNNs and remaining 1638 images for validating the performance of the CNNs. To input the images to the CNN models, the image dimension is re-sized to 224×224×3. Some example images from Oxford-102 Flowers dataset are shown in Fig. 2(b). 3) UC Merced Land Use Dataset: UC Merced Land Use dataset [42] contains images belonging to 21 categories of lands. This dataset has a total of 2100 images with 100 images in each class. The developed CNN models have trained over 80 images in each class, and the remaining 20 images are used to validate the performance of the models. The image dimensions are resized from 256 × 256 × 3 to 224 × 224 × 3. A few images from the UC Merced Land Use dataset are shown in Fig. 2(c). Next we present the result obtained by the proposed method when applied on the benchmark datasets. VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The NAS based CNNs available in the literature generally learn better performing CNN architectures for popular image classiﬁcation datasets such as ImageNet [10], CIFAR-10 [56] which have large number of training examples. However, the image datasets having less amount of training data are not experienced with the advantage of NAS methods. In this paper, we utilize three benchmark datasets for automatically tuning the FC layers of CNNs for better transfer learning. Due to the above reason, we compare the results obtained (a) (b) (c) Fig. 2. (a) A few set of images belong to CalTech-101 [40]. (b) A few random images from Oxford-102 Flowers [41]. (c) Some example images from UC Merced Land Use dataset [42].

A. CalTech-101 Image Classiﬁcation Results To learn the best set of hyperparameters involved in the FC layers of a CNN, we employ two popularly adopted search methods in the literature of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Those two search methods include i) Bayesian Optimization and ii) Random Search. Random search chooses the hyperparameters to explore randomly. In our experimental settings, the number of iterations for random sampling is set to 100. Table III presents the comparison among the performance of proxy CNN models (ﬁne-tuning the best FC layer structure learned during the search process) found using Bayesian search and Random search over CalTech-101 dataset. Table III also lists the best possible set of hyperparameter values like the number of FC layers, type of activation, number of neurons in each FC layer, and the dropout factor for each FC layer that are learned during the search process. For example, the best structure of FC layers learned using Bayesian optimization for VGG-16 results in 92.72% validation accuracy. After ﬁnding the best set of FC layers’ hyperparameters using Algorithm 1, we ﬁne-tune the FC layers of the developed CNN models over the CalTech-101 dataset.

The CNN models are trained for 200 epochs using AdaGrad optimizer [25]. We consider the values of other hyperparameters such as the learning rate similar to the setting of training the proxy CNNs explored during the search process. Fine-tuning the FC layers (learned using the proposed AutoFCL) results in state-of-the-art accuracy 94.38% on CalTech-101 dataset. B. Oxford-102 Flowers Image Classiﬁcation Results The optimal FC layers hyperparameters learned for the Oxford-102 Flowers dataset using Bayesian Optimization and random search are shown in Table V. Similar to CalTech- 101 dataset, once the search process is completed, the FC layers of the CNN (the best FC layer structure found during the search process) are ﬁne-tuned over the Oxford- 102 Flowers dataset for 200 epochs using AdaGrad optimizer [25]. The proposed AutoFCL achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.83% on Oxford-102 Flowers dataset. Table IV summarizes the performance obtained using the various CNN models with the target-dependent FC layer structure. The VGG-16 and ResNet-50 achieve the best and second- best state-of-the-art accuracy, respectively over Oxford-102 Flowers dataset. C. UC Merced Land Use Image Classiﬁcation Results We consider UC Merced Land Use as another image dataset to learn the best structure of FC layers for efﬁcient transfer learning. The proposed method produces comparable results over UC Merced Land use dataset as presented in Table IV. From Table IV we can observe that ﬁne-tuning the FC layers learned using the proposed AutoFCL for VGG-16 produces 96.83% validation accuracy, which is second best state-of-the-art accuracy. Table VI lists the best conﬁguration of hyperparameters involved in FC layers found using both Bayesian search and random search. We also compared the performance of the proposed method with ﬁne-tuning original CNN architectures over the target dataset. Fine- tuning the target-dependent FC layer’s structure of a CNN over the target dataset results in better performance com- pared to ﬁne-tuning with the target-independent FC layer’s structure. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the proposed AutoFCL outperforms traditional ﬁne-tuning of original FC layers of CNN architectures. VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE We propose AutoFCL, a method to learn the best possible set of hyperparameters belonging to Fully Connected (dense) layers of a CNN for improved transfer learning. Finding the structure of FC layers with the knowledge of target data re- sults in better performance while transferring the knowledge from one task to other. The Bayesian Optimization algorithm is used to explore the search space for the number of FC layers, the number of neurons in each FC layer, activation function and dropout factor. To learn the structure of FC layers, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets. The proposed AutoFCL method outperforms the state-of-the- art on most of the datasets. In future, the proposed idea of tuning the pre-trained CNN layers may be extended to tuning TABLE VI THE FC LAYERS’ HYPERPARAMETERS ARE TUNED FOR UC MERCED LAND USE DATASET AUTOMATICALLY USING THE BAYESIAN SEARCH AND RANDOM SEARCH ARE PRESENTED.
