Higher values of the willingness to pay are found also if the project is certified (Blasch and Farsi, 2012, 2014; MacKerron et al., 2009), is co-financed by airlines (Schwirplies et al., 2017) and is implemented in the respondent’s home country (Cheung et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2018; Hinnen et al., 2015; Schwirplies et al., 2017). 3. The questionnaire and the sample interviewed The survey was conducted in May 2018 with 1228 respondents. All the interviews were administered face-to-face in order to increase the representativeness of the sample, enhance the response rate and better control the quality of the data collected. A team of researchers trained to guarantee the homogeneity of the procedure used to collect the data carried out the interviews. The interviewers used printed questionnaires. The questionnaires differed according to the distance travelled in the last flight taken by the respondents. The choice tasks were printed in cards that were shown to the respondents during the interview. Respondents were selected randomly using a counting design according to which each fortieth person passing in front of the interviewer was asked to participate to the survey (Bell et al., 2019). Only people who had travelled by plane within the last three years were interviewed. The interviews were performed in Friuli Venezia Giulia, a northeastern region of Italy and took place at the Friuli Venezia Giulia airport and at railway and bus stations. 3.1. The questionnaire We structured the questionnaire into four parts. The first part focused on the respondents’ beliefs about climate change, in line with the methodology proposed by Sonnenschein and Smedby (2018), Choi (2015), Hinnen et al. (2015), Jou and Chen (2015), Choi and Ritchie (2014), van Birgelen et al. (2011), Akter et al. (2009) and Brouwer et al. (2008). We asked the respondent to state if s/he believes that climate change is going on and to what extent it is caused by human activities. Previous research (Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016) demonstrated that social-psychological factors and climate change perception, such as environmental values, climate change knowledge, and opinions about climate change increase the propensity to adopt environmentally friendly measures4. At the end of the interview, we also asked if the respondent has ever joined an environmental association or if s/he has ever participated in environmental protests seeking to bring recognition of how people, companies, or governments impact the environment. The second part of the questionnaire collected information on the respondent’s travel behaviour and asked about the air travel frequency in the last three years, the purpose and destination (domestic, continental or intercontinental) of the last journey travelled by plane, the number of family members accompanying the respondent in the last journey travelled and the chosen airline. In the third part of the ques- tionnaire, six hypothetical choice scenarios were administered to each respondent. The respondent was invited to imagine that s/he had to take the same type of flight s/he took the last time s/he travelled by plane (domestic, continental or intercontinental) and that s/he was offered the possibility of making a donation aimed at reducing or off- setting the quantity of CO2 emissions produced during the flight. The values proposed in the choice tasks differed according to the flight type and are described in Table 3. To increase the realism of the hypothetical exercise, we presented to the respondent the average quantity of CO2 emitted per flight (round trip) per person. Such a quantity is 0.22 tons for a domestic flight, 0.6 tons for a continental flight and 3.3 tons for an intercontinental flight. The quantity of CO2 reduced or offset could be “small (10%)”, “half the quantity produced (50%)” or “large (100%)”. The respondents were also informed about the type of projects their donation would be invested in. The funds could be used to finance projects aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the aircraft technology and at enhancing the use of alternative fuels, or to finance afforestation, reforestation and forests protection.\"\n",
    "texto3 = 'the carbon offset prices, ranging between a low assumption of €5–€9 per ton to a high assumption of €18–€29 per ton in 2020 and 2030, respectively.6 Moreover, they are in line with the estimates we obtained in a previous research focused on the willingness to pay per ton of CO2 produced by road transport (Rotaris and Danielis, 2019). Finally, comparing our estimates with the social cost per ton of CO2, which is equal to €32 according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2016), we find that the willingness to pay of Italian air travellers is in line with the value of the negative externalities produced. The estimates of the social costs of one ton of CO2 is however highly uncertain, as documented by Nocera et al. (2018). 4.2. Willingness to pay per flight We also calculated the median willingness to pay for a net-zero carbon emission flight at the individual level, distinguishing by type of flight (domestic, continental and international flights) and by project purpose. Averaging the values calculated for each individual, we obtained the values reported in Table 7. Our results are in line with the findings reported by van Birgelen et al. (2011) and within the range of values reported by Hinnen et al. (2015) and Cheung et al. (2015). The differences between our results and the findings reported by other authors might be due to the methodology used to collect the data (face-to-face vs. online survey) and the use of contingent valuation experiments instead of choice experiments (e.g. Fatihah and Rahim, 2017; Jou and Chen, 2015). The absence of the “no choice” option (e.g. Araghi et al., 2016; Choi, 2015) could have also made the difference, since it reduces the realism of the choice tasks and influences the estimates obtained, as demonstrated by Brazell et al. (2006) and Paredes-García and Casta˜no-Tostado (2019). Finally, the sample selection (e.g. in Choi, 2015; Fatihah and Rahim, 2017 also non-air travellers were interviewed) and the nationality of the sample could have had a role too. Our estimates are higher than the voluntary contribution proposed by the airlines used by our sample when the interviews were performed, which ranged from a minimum of €3 per flight (Swiss International Airlines; British Airways; Iberia; Vueling) to a maximum of €23 per flight (US Airways; British Airways; Iberia; Vueling).

Conclusions According to our results, the willingness to pay of Italian air travellers to reduce or offset the carbon emissions produced ranges from €12 to €38 per ton and from €14 to €66 per flight. The value depends on the quantity of CO2 reduced or offset, the type of project financed via the donation, the distance travelled and the socio-demographic characteristics of the travellers. The willingness to pay is significantly lower if the aim of the project is not mentioned. Forest protection, afforestation or reforestation are preferred to projects aimed at aircraft technological improvement and at increasing the use of alternative fuels. We also found that the willingness to pay is lower for frequent flyers, for people travelling for business, for men, for unemployed and for people having a lower education degree. The values we have found are above the current prices of the certified emissions credits traded in the voluntary markets, which in 2018 ranged from €3 to €5, and it will suffice even if in the near future the prices increase up to €18, as predicted by ICAO. As for the social cost of the emissions produced, Italians’ willingness to pay per ton would cover a large part of the value of the damage they cause due to their transport choice (estimated equal to €32 per ton by EPA, 2016). The implications of our results for airlines are numerous. Firstly, air travellers should be offered the possibility to pay to reduce or offset the carbon emissions they produce.'\n",

Having a higher income level (Akter et al., 2009; Araghi et al., 2016; Blasch and Farsi, 2012, 2014; Brouwer et al., 2008; Cheung et al., 2015; Choi, 2015; Fatihah and Rahim, 2017; 2012;; Schwirplies et al., 2017) and being more educated (Cheung et al., 2015) are positively related to the willingness to pay. Also being female (Choi and Ritchie, 2014; MacKerron et al., 2009; Sonnenschein and Smedby, 2018) and being younger (Blasch and Farsi, 2012, 2014; Fatihah and Rahim, 2017; Lu and Shon, 2012; Schwirplies et al., 2017) are positively linked to the willingness to pay. Travel behaviour plays an important role too, since for short-haul flights the estimated willingness to pay is on average higher (Akter et al., 2009; Brouwer et al., 2008; Choi, 2015; Choi and Ritchie, 2014). The empirical evidence with respect to travel frequency, instead, is mixed: some research studies report a positive relationship (Akter et al., 2009; Araghi et al., Table 2 Literature review results.

Finally, having a sense of responsibility for the emissions produced travelling by plane, believing that offsetting makes a high contribution to climate protection or being environmental conscious are positively related with the estimates obtained in all the studies that have controlled for these factors. It is also found that the willingness to pay is higher if the project is aimed at reforestation (Akter et al., 2009; Schwirplies et al., 2017) and at increasing the use of renewable energy (Cheung et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2018; Choi and Ritchie, 2014). Higher values of the willingness to pay are found also if the project is certified (Blasch and Farsi, 2012, 2014; MacKerron et al., 2009), is co-financed by airlines (Schwirplies et al., 2017) and is implemented in the respondent’s home country (Cheung et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2018; Hinnen et al., 2015; Schwirplies et al., 2017). 3.
